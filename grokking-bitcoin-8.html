<p>Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: the shared folder. All blocks
the miners produce must pass through the shared folder on their way to
other full nodes and miners. This chapter will remove the central shared
folder and replace it with a decentralized <em>peer-to-peer network</em>
(<a href="#fig0801">Figure 1</a>). The peer-to-peer network lets full nodes (including
miners) send blocks directly to each other. When nodes can talk directly
to each other, we no longer need a central point of authority for
communication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another issue we haven’t talked much about is how wallets send
transactions via email to the miners. When a new miner joins the system,
all wallets need to update their miner list. Not cool. With this nice
peer-to-peer network of nodes, wallets can broadcast their transactions
to all miners without knowing who or where they are.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ll follow a transaction’s path through the network, both as an
unconfirmed transaction and, eventually, as part of a mined block. The
transaction will start in John’s wallet and end as a confirmed
transaction in the blockchain with Bob’s wallet being notified about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After following the transaction through the system, you’ll no longer
need the cookie token system to help you understand Bitcoin. We’ll talk
only about Bitcoin from that point forward. Practically no differences
exist between the cookie token system and Bitcoin anymore, so it doesn’t
make sense to keep talking about cookie tokens when, in fact, you want
to learn about Bitcoin!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last topic in this chapter will cover how a new node connects to and
becomes part of the peer-to-peer network. This is far from trivial. How
does it find nodes to connect to? How does it download the blockchain up
to the latest block? We’ll sort all that out. Toward the end of the
chapter, you’ll learn how to set up a full node of your own.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_shared_folder">8.1. The shared folder</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The shared folder administrator, Luke, is a central authority
(<a href="#fig0802">Figure 2</a>). He ultimately gets to decide which blocks can be stored
in the shared folder. He also gets to decide who can read from and
write to the shared folder.</p>
</div>
<div id="fig0802" class="imageblock">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 2. The shared folder is a central point of authority.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, we’ve assumed Luke is a totally neutral good guy—but what if he
isn’t, or what if he’s forced by Acme Insurances to reject certain
blocks? What’s the point of proof of work if the system can be censored
at the block level? Proof of work made the <em>transactions</em>
censorship-resistant because it let users send their transactions to
multiple miners. But the <em>blocks</em> containing the transactions can still
be censored by whoever has administrator privileges over the shared
folder. Simply put, the system isn’t yet censorship-resistant. As long
as a single entity can decide which blocks or transactions to allow, the
system isn’t censorship-resistant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The shared folder poses yet another problem. Imagine that Rashid has
created a 1 MB block and published it to the shared folder. Everyone
watching the shared folder, all full nodes, will download Rashid’s block
at the same time. If you have 100 full nodes, the total amount of data
you need to send from the shared folder to the different nodes is
100 MB. This will cause <em>block propagation</em>—the transfer of a block
from its creator to all other nodes—to be terribly slow. The more nodes,
the slower the block propagation.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>What if the full nodes and miners could talk directly to each other
instead of relying on the central shared folder? They could send the
blocks directly to one another in a peer-to-peer network (<a href="#fig0803">Figure 3</a>).</p>

<div class="title">Figure 3. In a peer-to-peer network, blocks are passed from one node to another, much as gossip spreads among people.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Think of the peer-to-peer network as a large number of people. One
person doesn’t know everyone else, but might know three people. When
something interesting happens—for example, Rashid finds a block—he tells
his three friends about it, who in turn tell all their friends, and so
on until everybody knows about this new block. We call such networks
<em>gossip networks</em> for apparent reasons.</p>
</div>

<div class="title">Relay</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To <em>relay</em> a received block means to pass the block on to others.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph important">
<p>Blocks can no longer be easily stopped. A node can choose not to pass a
block on, or <em>relay</em> it, to its peers, but the peers are connected to
several other peers that will gladly relay the block to them. A single
node can’t do much to censor information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose Rashid finds a block, and he wants to get this block out to
all nodes. Rashid sends his block to Qi, Tom, and the cafe. For some
reason, the cafe doesn’t forward the block to Lisa (<a href="#fig0804">Figure 4</a>). But
Lisa has several peers in this network. She’s connected to Tom
and Qi. Tom will tell Lisa about this new block and send it
to her. The cafe can’t hide information from Lisa as long as she’s
well-connected—that is, has many different peers.</p>

<p>Now that you have this nice network, wallets can use it to get their
transactions sent to miners. Then they won’t have to keep track of
miner email addresses anymore. The transactions will be broadcast over
the peer-to-peer network and reach all full nodes within seconds. This
includes the miners, because they’re also full nodes. We covered this
briefly in <a href="#ch01">[ch01]</a>, as repeated in <a href="#fig0805">Figure 5</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same thing goes here as for blocks: a single node can’t hinder
transactions from spreading across the network. Another pleasant
effect of using the peer-to-peer network for transactions is that a
transaction’s recipient can be notified that the transaction is
<em>pending</em>, or is about to be confirmed. We’ll look at how this works
a bit later.</p>

<p>Let’s look at how the communication between two peers happens. We’ll
look specifically at how Tom connects to Lisa and how they communicate
across their communication channel, called a Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) connection (<a href="#fig0806">Figure 6</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose Tom’s node knows about Lisa’s node. I’ll explain in
<a href="#bootstrapping-the-network">Section 8.7</a> how Tom learns about other nodes. For now,
let’s assume he has the <em>IP address</em> and <em>port</em> of Lisa’s node. He now
wants to connect to Lisa’s node to communicate with it. All computers on
the internet have an Internet Protocol (IP) address, which is how one
computer can send information to another. A computer program that
listens for incoming connections must listen on a specific port number
of its computer’s IP address. Lisa’s computer has the IP address
142.12.233.96 and runs a cookie token program that listens for incoming
connections on port 8333.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock inbitcoin">

<p>Port 8333 is the default listening port in Bitcoin Core, the most
widely used full node software.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tom’s node connects to Lisa’s node through the IP address
142.12.233.96 and TCP port 8333. His node (computer program) starts by
asking its operating system (OS) to initiate a connection to Lisa
(<a href="#fig0807">Figure 7</a>). The OS sends a message to Lisa’s computer saying that
Tom wants to talk to a computer program on Lisa’s port 8333. Her
computer knows a program is listening on port 8333, so it sends back a
“Sure, welcome” message.  Tom’s computer acknowledges this by sending
back an “OK, cool. Let’s talk …” message.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The node software on Tom’s and Lisa’s computers wasn’t involved in this
exchange—it was carried out by their OSs, such as Linux, Windows, or
macOS. When the message sequence is finished, the OS hands the
connection over to the node software. Lisa’s and Tom’s nodes can now
speak freely to each other. Tom can send data to Lisa, and Lisa can send
data to Tom over this communication channel, or <em>TCP connection</em>.</p>

<p>Tom and Lisa can now send and receive data over a communi­cation
channel. But if Tom’s node speaks a language that Lisa’s node doesn’t
understand, the communication won’t be meaningful (<a href="#fig0808">Figure 8</a>). The
nodes must have a common language: a <em>protocol</em>.</p>

<p>The cookie token network protocol defines a set of message types that
are allowed. A typical message in the cookie token (well, Bitcoin)
network is the <code>inv</code> message (<a href="#fig0809">Figure 9</a>).</p>

and a block. The message contains an ID for each of these items.</p>

<p>In <a href="#lightweight-wallets">[lightweight-wallets]</a>, we said that wallets can connect to full

<p>I didn’t go into detail then about how this communication works. It uses
the same protocol the nodes use when they communicate with each other.
The wallets and the full nodes (including miners) all speak the same
“language.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose John wants to buy a cookie from the cafe. John’s wallet is
connected to Tom’s node with a TCP connection. He scans the payment URI
from the cafe’s wallet. John’s wallet creates and signs a transaction.
You know the drill. Then it’s time to send the transaction to Tom’s node
(<a href="#fig0811">Figure 11</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This happens in a three-step process. John’s wallet doesn’t just send
the transaction unsolicited: it first informs Tom’s node that there’s a
transaction to be fetched (<a href="#fig0812">Figure 12</a>).</p>

<div class="title">Figure 12. Tom’s node is informed about John’s transaction so that Tom can fetch it.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first message is an <code>inv</code> message, as described in the previous
section. John’s wallet sends the <code>inv</code> to Tom’s full node. Tom checks if
he already has the transaction. He doesn’t, because John’s wallet just
created it and hasn’t sent it to anyone yet. Tom’s node wants to get
this transaction, so he requests it with a <code>getdata</code> message that looks
just like an <code>inv</code> message but with a different meaning: <code>getdata</code>
means “I want this stuff,” whereas <code>inv</code> means “I have this stuff.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>John’s wallet receives the <code>getdata</code> message and sends a <code>tx</code> message
containing the entire transaction to Tom’s node. Tom will verify the
transaction and keep it. He’ll also relay this transaction to his
network neighbors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might ask, “Why doesn’t John’s wallet send the entire transaction
immediately? Why go through the hassle with <code>inv</code> and <code>getdata</code>?” This
will become clear later, but it’s because nodes might already have the
transaction; we save bandwidth by sending only transaction hashes
instead of entire transactions.</p>

<p>Lisa was quick to verify the transaction, so she’ll be the first of the
three to relay it. She already knows that she received the transaction
from Tom, so she won’t inform Tom’s node with an <code>inv</code> message. But Lisa
doesn’t know that Qi already has the transaction, and she doesn’t know
if the cafe has it. She’ll send an <code>inv</code> to those two nodes. The cafe’s
node will send back a <code>getdata</code> because it hasn’t yet seen this
transaction. Qi’s node already has this transaction and won’t reply with
anything (<a href="#fig0815">Figure 15</a>). She’ll remember that Lisa has it, though.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I said earlier that a good thing about letting transactions travel the
peer-to-peer network is that the recipient wallet can get a quick
notification of the pending transaction. Let’s explore this now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cafe’s full node has received the transaction and verified it. The
cafe also has a lightweight wallet on a mobile phone that it uses to
send and receive money. The cafe is concerned with security, so it
configured this lightweight wallet to connect only the cafe’s own full
node, its <em>trusted node</em> (<a href="#fig0816">Figure 16</a>).</p>

<p>This common setup gives the cafe the complete security of a full node
combined with the flexibility and mobility of a lightweight wallet. I
described this setup in <a href="#security-of-lightweight-wallets">[security-of-lightweight-wallets]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cafe’s full node has just verified John’s transaction. It now wants
to inform its neighbors about this new transaction. It’s connected to
Lisa’s node, Rashid’s node, and the cafe’s lightweight wallet. The full
node already knows that Lisa’s and Rashid’s nodes have this transaction,
so it doesn’t send an <code>inv</code> to those two nodes. The full node doesn’t
know whether the wallet has the transaction, but it won’t immediately
send an <code>inv</code> message to the wallet.</p>

<p>The wallet is a lightweight wallet, which uses bloom filters,
described in <a href="#bloom-filters-obfuscate-addresses">[bloom-filters-obfuscate-addresses]</a>. The full node will
test the transaction against the bloom filter and, if it matches, send
an <code>inv</code> message to the wallet. If there’s no match, it won’t send an
<code>inv</code> message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>John’s transaction is for the cafe, so the bloom filter will match the
transaction, and the full node will send an <code>inv</code>. The wallet will
request the actual transaction using <code>getdata</code>, as <a href="#fig0817">Figure 17</a> shows.</p>

<p>The wallet has now received the transaction. It can show a message to
the cafe owner that a transaction is pending. The cafe owner has a
choice: trust that the transaction—a so-called <em>0-conf
transaction</em>—will be confirmed eventually, or wait until the
transaction is confirmed. If the cafe accepts the 0-conf transaction,
then it trusts that John has paid a high enough transaction fee and that
the transaction won’t be double spent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This time, the cafe decides that it needs to wait until the transaction
is included in a valid block. This brings us to the next phase:
including the transaction in a block in the blockchain.</p>

are the only miners in this system right now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transaction reached all these miners during transaction propagation.
John’s wallet used to send the transaction via email to all miners. Now,
he sends it to any of the full nodes, and it propagates across the entire
peer-to-peer network. Miners can choose to include John’s transaction in
the blocks they’re mining. Suppose the transaction includes a
transaction fee so that some or all miners are willing to include it,
and that Rashid is the next miner to find a valid proof of work for his
block, which happens to contain John’s transaction (<a href="#fig0818">Figure 18</a>).</p>

<p>As you might recall from <a href="#ch06">[ch06]</a>, lightweight wallets don’t download
the full blocks. Most of the time, John’s wallet is only interested in
the block headers so it can verify the blockchain’s proof of work. But
every now and then, transactions that are relevant to John’s wallet
are in the blocks, and the wallet wants proof that those transactions
are included in the block. To find out if there are any relevant
transactions, he sends a <code>getdata</code> message to Tom, requesting a

<p>To download Bitcoin Core, Selma visits its web page,
<a href="https://bitcoincore.org" class="bare">https://bitcoincore.org</a>, and finds a download link there. But she
encounters a potential problem: Selma isn’t sure the program she
downloads is actually the version the developers behind Bitcoin Core
released. Someone could have fooled Selma into downloading the program
from bitconcore.org instead of bitcoincore.org, or someone might have
hacked bitcoincore.org and replaced the downloadable files with
alternative programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Bitcoin Core team therefore signs all released versions of the
program with a private key—let’s call it the <em>Bitcoin Core
key</em>. They provide the signature in a downloadable file, named
SHA256SUMS.asc. This file contains the hash value of the released
Bitcoin Core software and a signature that signs the contents of the
SHA256SUMS.asc file (<a href="#fig0828">Figure 28</a>).</p>

<p>This is a hard problem. Remember when Lisa used to sign blocks with her

the office, checking the company’s intranet, and asking colleagues. The
same applies here; you shouldn’t trust a single source, but should use
at least two different sources. The key that’s currently being used to

<div class="title">Figure 30. Selma’s full node has three different types of sources to find initial peers.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph important">
<p>Selma’s node shouldn’t initially connect to just one node. If that
single node is malicious, she’d have no way of knowing it. If you
connect to multiple nodes initially, you can verify that they all send
data consistent with each other. If not, one or more nodes are
deliberately lying to you, or they themselves have been fooled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default way of finding initial node addresses is to look them up in
the DNS system. DNS is a global name lookup system, used to look up IP
numbers from computer names. For example, when you visit
<a href="https://bitcoin.org" class="bare">https://bitcoin.org</a> with your web browser, it will use DNS to look up
the IP number of the name bitcoin.org. The Bitcoin Core software does
the same. Names to look up are hardcoded into Bitcoin Core, just like
the hardcoded IP addresses and ports. Several DNS seeds are coded into
the software. A lookup of a DNS seed can return several IP addresses,
and every new lookup might return a different set of IP addresses. The
final, third option is used as a last resort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note from <a href="#fig0830">Figure 30</a> that DNS lookups don’t return port numbers. The
other two methods of finding initial peers usually include one, but
the DNS response can return only IP addresses. The nodes on these IP
addresses are assumed to listen on the default port that Bitcoin Core
listens on, which is 8333.</p>

<p>Suppose Selma’s node chooses to connect to Qi’s node, 1.234.63.203:4567,
and to Rashid’s node, 47.196.31.246:8333. Selma sets up a TCP connection
to each of the two nodes and sends an initial message to both of them on
the new TCP connections. Let’s look at how she talks to Qi’s node
(<a href="#fig0831">Figure 31</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The exchange, called a <em>handshake</em>, starts with Selma, who sends a
<code>version</code> message to Qi. The handshake is used to agree on which
protocol version to use and tell each other what block heights they
have. The <code>version</code> message contains a lot of information not shown in
the figure, but the most essential stuff is there:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Protocol version</dt>
<dd>
<p>The version of the network protocol, or “language,”
that peers use to talk to each other. Selma and Qi will use version
70012 because that’s the highest version Qi will understand. Selma knows
all protocol versions up to her own.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">User agent</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is shown as “software identification” in the figure
because “user agent” is a bit cryptic. It’s used to hint to the other
node what software you’re running, but it can be anything.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Height</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the height of the tip of the best chain the node has.</p>

<dd>
<p>A list of features this node supports, such as bloom
filtering used by lightweight clients.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">My address</dt>
<dd>
<p>The IP address and port of the node sending the <code>version</code>
message. Without it, Qi wouldn’t know what address to connect to if she
restarts and wants to reconnect to Selma’s node.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Qi’s node receives Selma’s <code>version</code> message, Qi will reply with
her own <code>version</code> message. She’ll also send a <code>verack</code> message
immediately after the <code>version</code> message. The <code>verack</code> doesn’t contain
any information; rather, it’s used to acknowledge to Selma that Qi has
received the <code>version</code> message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As soon as Selma’s node receives Qi’s <code>version</code> message, it will reply
with a <code>verack</code> message back to Qi’s node. The handshake is done. Selma
also goes through the same procedure with Rashid’s node.</p>

two nodes has some implications:</p>

<p>Qi and Rashid can collude to hide transactions and blocks from Selma.</p>

<p>Selma sends a <code>getaddr</code> message to a peer, Rashid’s node. Rashid
responds with a set of IP addresses and TCP ports that Selma can use to
connect to more peers. Rashid chooses which addresses to send to Selma,
but it’s usually the addresses to which Rashid is already connected and
possibly some that Rashid collected from his peers but didn’t use
himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Selma will connect to any number of the received addresses to increase
her <em>connectivity</em>. The more peers you’re connected to, the better
your connectivity. A high degree of connectivity decreases the risk of
missing out on information due to misbehaving peers. Also, information
propagates more quickly if nodes have higher connectivity. A typical
full node in Bitcoin has about 100 active connections at the same
time.  Only eight (by default) of those are <em>outbound connections</em>,
meaning connections initiated by that node. The rest are <em>inbound
connections</em> initiated by other nodes. Consequently, a full node that
isn’t reachable on port 8333 from the internet—for example, due to a
firewall—won’t get more than eight connections in total.</p>

<p>Now that Selma is well-connected to, and part of, the Bitcoin network,
it’s time for her to download and verify the full blockchain up to the
latest block available. This process is called <em>synchronization</em>,
<em>sync</em>, or <em>initial blockchain download</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Selma has only a single block: the genesis block. The genesis block is
hardcoded in the Bitcoin Core software, so all nodes have this block
when they start.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She needs to download all historic blocks from her peers and verify
them before she can verify newly created blocks. This is because she
has no idea what the current unspent transaction output (UTXO) set
looks like.  To build the current UTXO set, she needs to start with an
empty UTXO set, go through all historic blocks from block 0, and
update the UTXO set with the information in the transactions in the
blocks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Download all historic block headers from one peer, and verify the

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Selma selects one of her peers, Tom, to download all block headers
from.  <a href="#fig0834">Figure 34</a> shows how Selma’s node downloads the block headers
from Tom’s node.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock gbinfo">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Simplified</div>

<p>The <code>getheaders</code> message contains a list of some block IDs from Selma’s

Tom doesn’t have Selma’s tip. Let’s not bother with that.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She sends a <code>getheaders</code> message containing Selma’s latest block ID,
which happens to be the genesis block, block 0. Tom sends back a list of
2,000 block headers; each block header is 80 bytes. Selma verifies each
header’s proof of work and requests a new batch of headers from Tom.
This process continues until Selma receives a batch of fewer than 2,000
headers from Tom, which is a signal that he has no more headers to give
her.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Selma has received all the headers from Tom, she determines which
branch is the strongest and starts downloading actual block data
belonging to that branch from her peers. She can download block data
from multiple peers at the same time to speed things up. <a href="#fig0835">Figure 35</a>
shows her communication with Rashid’s node.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, Selma requests 3 blocks at a time, but in reality,
Bitcoin Core would request a list of at most 16 blocks per batch.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It starts with Selma, who sends a <code>getdata</code> message to Rashid. This
message specifies which blocks she wants to download from Rashid, who
sends back the requested blocks in <code>block</code> messages, one by one. Note
that Selma downloads only some of the blocks from Rashid. She also
downloads blocks from Tom in parallel, which is why there are gaps in
the sequence of requested blocks. The process repeats until Selma
doesn’t want any more blocks from Rashid.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Selma downloads blocks, Rashid will probably receive more fresh
blocks from his peers. Suppose he has received a new block by the time
Selma has received the first 100 blocks from Rashid. Rashid will then
send out a <code>headers</code> message to his peers, including Selma, as
described in <a href="#include-the-transaction-in-a-block">Section 8.4.4</a>. This way, Selma
will be aware of all new blocks appearing during her initial
synchronization and can later request them from any peer.</p>

adds them to her own blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="validating-early-blocks">Verifying early blocks</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most time-consuming part of verifying a block is verifying the
transaction signatures. If you know of any block ID that’s part of a
valid blockchain, you can skip verifying the signatures of all blocks
prior to and including this block (<a href="#fig0836">Figure 36</a>). This will greatly speed
up the initial blockchain download up to that block.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, other stuff, like verifying that no double spends occur or
that the block rewards are correct, is still done. The syncing node must
build its own UTXO set, so it must still go through all transactions to
be able to update the UTXO set accordingly.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is about 10,000 blocks back in the blockchain at release date. This
is, of course, a configuration parameter, and the aforementioned block
is just a default reasonable value. Selma could have changed this when
starting her node, or she could have verified with friends and other
sources she trusts that this block is in fact representing an “all valid
transactions blockchain.” She could also have disabled the feature to
verify all transaction signatures since block 0.</p>

<p>To verify that the signature in the signature file was done using the
Bitcoin Core signing key, you need the corresponding public key. As
noted in <a href="#step-1">Section 8.7.1</a>, you should convince yourself about what
fingerprint the Bitcoin Core key has and then download that key from
any source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You could, for example,</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get the fingerprint of the Bitcoin Core team’s key from
<a href="https://bitcoincore.org" class="bare">https://bitcoincore.org</a>, the official website of the Bitcoin Core
team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consult the book <em>Grokking Bitcoin</em> to verify the fingerprint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify the fingerprint with a friend.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Start by finding the Bitcoin Core team’s public key fingerprint on their
website. You find the following fingerprint on the downloads page:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>01EA5486DE18A882D4C2684590C8019E36C2E964</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, consult the book <em>Grokking Bitcoin</em> to check if the fingerprint
in that book matches the fingerprint from
<a href="https://bitcoincore.org" class="bare">https://bitcoincore.org</a>. Look in the <a href="#step-1">Section 8.7.1</a> of <a href="#ch08">Chapter 8</a> of that
book. It says</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>01EA 5486 DE18 A882 D4C2  6845 90C8 019E 36C2 E964</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the same fingerprint (although formatted slightly
differently).  The book and the website <a href="https://bitcoincore.org" class="bare">https://bitcoincore.org</a> both
claim that this key belongs to the Bitcoin Core team. Let’s not settle
for that. You’ll also call a friend you trust and have her read the
fingerprint to you:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>You:</strong> “Hello, Donna! What’s the fingerprint of the current Bitcoin Core
signing key?”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Donna:</strong> “Hi! I verified that key myself a few months ago, and I know
the fingerprint is <code>01EA 5486 DE18 A882 D4C2 6845 90C8 019E 36C2 E964</code>.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>You:</strong> “Thank you, it matches mine. Goodbye!”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Donna:</strong> “You’re welcome. Goodbye!”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Donna’s statement further strengthens your trust in this key. You think
you’ve collected enough evidence that this is, in fact, the correct key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s start downloading the key. To do this, you can use a tool called
gpg, which stands for GnuPG, which in turn stands for Gnu Privacy Guard.
This program conforms to a standard called OpenPGP (Pretty Good
Privacy). This standard specifies how keys can be exchanged and how to
do encryption and digital signatures in an interoperable way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GnuPG is available on most Linux computers by default. To download a
public key with a certain fingerprint, you run the following <code>gpg</code>
command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ gpg --recv-keys 01EA5486DE18A882D4C2684590C8019E36C2E964
gpg: key 90C8019E36C2E964: public key "Wladimir J. van der Laan (Bitcoin Core binary release signing key) &lt;laanwj@gmail.com&gt;" imported
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the version of gpg you use, the output can vary. This
command downloads the public key from any available key server and
verifies that the downloaded public key in fact has the fingerprint that
you requested. The owner of this key is “Wladimir J. van der Laan
(Bitcoin Core binary release signing key).”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The prior command downloads the key into gpg and adds it to your list of
known keys. But the output of this command mentions “no ultimately
trusted keys found.” This means this key isn’t signed by any key that
you trust. You’ve only imported the key. In gpg, keys can sign other
keys to certify that the signed key is legit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_signing_the_public_key_as_trusted_on_your_computer">Signing the public key as trusted on your computer</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ve verified that the key belongs to the Bitcoin Core team and
installed that key onto your system using gpg.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ll now sign that key with a private key that you own. You do this to
remember this key as trusted. The Bitcoin Core team will probably
release new versions of Bitcoin Core in the future. If GnuPG remembers
this public key as trusted, you won’t have to go through all these
key-verification steps again when you upgrade.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process is as follows:</p>

prevent blocks and transactions from propagating the network.</p>

this propagation includes sending the block to lightweight wallets.

<p>Suppose you’re running a full node and experience a power
outage for 18 minutes. When power comes back, you start your node again.
During those 18 minutes, two blocks, B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub>, have been created.
Your latest block is B<sub>0</sub>. What will your node do after reconnecting to
the network? For simplicity, assume that no new blocks are found during
synchronization, and that you have only one peer. Use this table of

<p>The peer-to-peer network makes blocks censorship-resistant.</p>

<p>A node connects to multiple peers to reduce their vulnerability for
information hiding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Bitcoin network protocol is the “language” nodes speak to

<li>
<p>Transactions are broadcast on the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network to
reach both miners and the recipient of the money early.</p>

<li>
<p>New nodes synchronize with the Bitcoin network to get up to date
with the other nodes. This takes hours or days.</p>

<li>
<p>Nodes don’t need to stay online 24/7. They can drop out and come
back and sync up the latest stuff.</p>

<li>
<p>Signature verification can be skipped for older blocks to speed up
initial synchronization. This is useful if you know a specific block
is valid.</p>
