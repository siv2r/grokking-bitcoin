extra steps to use multiple addresses to preserve their privacy.</p>

<p>Among you and your coworkers, a group of software developers builds a
mobile app called a <em>wallet</em> to simplify common tasks for themselves
and other users. The group identifies the following tasks as the most
common:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Create new addresses</dt>
<dd>
<p>Users must create new cookie token addresses
every now and then. They might want to use different addresses for
different purposes or even different addresses for all payments for
privacy and security reasons.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Manage private keys</dt>
<dd>
<p>For each address created, the wallet needs to
store and manage the corresponding private key. Keeping private keys
safe from intruders is a delicate task.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Transfer payment details from payee to payer</dt>
<dd>
<p>When John wants to buy
a cookie, he needs to get the cafe’s address and the payment amount into
his app. Writing it by hand is cumbersome and error-prone, so it would
be nice if John could scan the details with his camera instead.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Make a payment</dt>
<dd>
<p>The app should be able to send an email to Lisa with
the digitally signed payment details.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Keep track of funds</dt>
<dd>
<p>Users want to know how many cookies they can
afford. The app should display the total number of cookie tokens a user
has.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Back up private keys</dt>
<dd>
<p>When private keys are created in the app, they
only exist in the app. If the mobile phone is lost or broken, the
private keys are gone. You know by now what happens when you lose your
keys, don’t you? You need a backup facility for private keys.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The development team builds an initial version of the app and calls it
the wallet. The term <em>wallet</em> isn’t perfect because the app doesn’t
really contain money. It contains the keys needed to spend money. The
actual money is stored in the spreadsheet. The app is more akin to a
physical keyring; but the term <em>wallet</em> is widely used in the Bitcoin
world for all things that store private keys, so we should get over it
and move on. Let’s go through this wallet’s features.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose, once again, that John wants to buy a cookie in the cafe
(<a href="#fig0402">Figure 2</a>). Both John and the cafe are using this new app.</p>

<p>The process goes through several steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">

<div class="title">QR codes</div>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The cafe asks its wallet to create a new address and request 10 CT
to that address. This new address and the amount are displayed on the
screen as a QR code. The QR code contains information on how much to
pay, so John doesn’t have to type that in manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John points his phone’s camera at the QR code to scan the payment
details. It scans the <em>payment URI</em> (uniform resource identifier, a
general specification on how to identify stuff; a web URL is an
example of a URI):</p>
<div class="literalblock">

<div class="olist arabic">

<div class="title">BIP21</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) are used to communicate ideas
among developers. Some BIPs are adopted in Bitcoin software projects;
others aren’t. All BIPs are available at <a href="#web-bips">[web-bips]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bitcoin adopted BIP21 as a way to transfer payment details from one
wallet to another using a URI. Bitcoin URIs start with <code>bitcoin:</code>
instead of <code>ct:</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="olist arabic">

<p>John’s wallet creates an email to Lisa that looks the same as
before.  The wallet automatically selects an address to send from and
signs the message with the correct private key. On Lisa’s side,
nothing has changed. She verifies and executes the payment exactly as
before.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s take a closer look at what John’s wallet does in step 4
(<a href="#fig0403">Figure 3</a>). The wallet does the same thing a user would do manually
in the earlier examples.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that the wallet manages three key pairs: two with funds and one
with no funds. With this new wallet, users can have as many addresses
as they want, which is good for privacy. The wallet will keep track of
them for the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cafe’s wallet, as well as John’s wallet, will check the spreadsheet
every now and then to see if there are any new payments concerning any
of the wallet’s keys, as a sender, a recipient, or both (<a href="#fig0404">Figure 4</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="fig0404" class="imageblock">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 4. John’s and the cafe’s wallets check the spreadsheet every few seconds. If a new payment, either incoming or outgoing, is found, the wallet updates the balance of the concerned keys and notifies its user.</div>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock inbitcoin">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Unconfirmed transactions</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Unconfirmed</em> means a transaction is created and sent to the Bitcoin
network, but it isn’t yet part of the Bitcoin blockchain. You shouldn’t
trust a payment until it’s part of the blockchain. The same goes for
cookie token payments—don’t trust payments that aren’t in the
spreadsheet.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even though John knows about the payment before Lisa confirms it in
the spreadsheet, his wallet won’t update the balance until it’s
confirmed.  Why? Lisa might not approve the payment. Maybe the payment
became corrupted during transfer, or the email ended up in Lisa’s spam
folder, so she doesn’t see it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the wallet updates the balance without first seeing it in the
spreadsheet, it could give false information to John. The wallet
could, of course, be kind enough to inform John that a payment is
pending confirmation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_private_key_backups">4.2. Private key backups</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The development team creates a feature to back up the wallet’s private
keys. The idea is that the wallet creates a text file, the backup file,
with all private keys in it and sends this file to an email address the
user chooses.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock gbinfo">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Why back up?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your keys hold your money. If you lose your keys, you lose your
money. A proper backup is <em>not</em> optional. You must take immediate,
active steps to make sure your keys are backed up; otherwise you will
sooner or later lose your money.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine that John wants to back up his private keys. The wallet collects
all the keys it has ever created and writes them into a text file
(<a href="#fig0405">Figure 5</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="fig0405" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch04/04-05.svg" alt="04 05" width="50%">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 5. John backs up his private keys. They’re sent in a text file to his email address.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The text file is emailed to John’s email address. Can you see any
problems with this? Yes, the biggest problem is that the keys have
left the privacy of the wallet application and are being sent into the
wild.  Anyone with access to the email server or any other systems
involved might be able to get the private keys without John noticing.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Problems</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Risk of theft</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excessive backups</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But another problem exists. As soon as John creates a new address
after the backup is made, this new address isn’t backed up. John must
make a new backup that includes the new key. For every new key, he
must make a new backup. Doing backups for every address becomes
tiresome for the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s look at a few simple solutions to these two problems:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Automatically send a backup when an address is created. This
increases the risk of theft because you send more backups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-create 100 addresses, and make a backup of them. Repeat when
the first 100 addresses are used. This also increases the risk of
theft, but not as much as solution 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encrypt the backup with a password. This will secure the backed-up
keys from theft.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A combination of solutions 2 and 3 seems like a good strategy; you
seldom need to do a backup, and the backups are secured by a strong
password.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process is similar to the previous process, but this time John
enters a password that’s used to encrypt the private keys
(<a href="#fig0406">Figure 6</a>).  If John loses his phone, he needs the password and the
backup file to restore his private keys.</p>
</div>
<div id="fig0406" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch04/04-06.svg" alt="04 06" width="50%">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 6. John backs up his private keys. They’re sent in a file encrypted with a password that John enters into his phone.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If John loses his phone, he can easily install the wallet app on
another phone. John sends the backup file to the app and enters his
password; the keys are decrypted from the backup file and added to his
wallet app.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_a_few_words_on_password_strength">4.2.1. A few words on password strength</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A password’s strength is measured in <em>entropy</em>. The higher the
entropy, the harder it is to guess the password. The word <em>entropy</em>,
as used in information security, comes from thermodynamics and means
disorder or uncertainty. Suppose you construct a password of 8
characters from among the following 64 characters:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch04/u04-03.svg" alt="u04 03">
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each character in the password would then represent 6 bits of entropy
because there are 64 = 2<sup>6</sup> possible characters. If you select the 8
characters randomly (no cherry-picking, please!), say <code>E3NrkbA7</code>, the
eight-character password will have 6 × 8 = 48 bits of entropy. This is
equivalent in strength to 48 coin flips.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch04/u04-02.svg" alt="u04 02">
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose instead that you select random words from a dictionary of
2<sup>11</sup>= 2,048 words. How many words do you need to use to beat the
48-bit entropy of your eight-character password? Four words wouldn’t
be enough because 4 × 11 = 44 bits of entropy. But five words
corresponds to 55 bits of entropy, which beats the password’s entropy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A password’s real entropy also depends on what an attacker knows about
the password. For example, suppose an attacker, Mallory, steals John’s
encrypted backup file and tries to perform a brute-force attack
on it. A <em>brute-force</em> attack means the attacker makes repeated
password guesses, over and over, until they find the correct
password. If Mallory knows the password’s length is exactly 8 and the
characters are chosen from the 64 characters mentioned, the entropy is
48 bits. If she happens to know that the second character is <code>3</code>, the
entropy drops to 6 × 7 = 42 bits. On the other hand, if Mallory
doesn’t know how many characters the password has, it will be harder
for her, meaning the entropy will be higher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is true only if password selection is truly random. If John uses
cherry-picking to select the password <code>j0Hn4321</code>, the entropy
decreases dramatically. Typical password brute-force attack programs
first try a lot of known words and names in different variations
before trying more “random-looking” passwords. John is a well-known
name, so an attacker will try a lot of different variations of that
name as well as many other names and words. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>butter122 … waLk129 … go0die muh4mm@d
john John JOhn JOHn JOHN j0hn j0Hn
jOhn jOHn jOHN … john1 …
… john12 J0hn12 … j0Hn321 …
j0Hn4321</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bingo! Suppose there are 1,000,000 common words and names, and each word
can come in 100,000 variations, on average. That’s 100 billion different
passwords to test, which corresponds to about 37 bits of entropy; 100
billion tries will take a high-end desktop computer a few days to
perform. Let’s say, for simplicity, that it takes one day. If John uses
a truly random password, the entropy for the attacker is around 48 bits.
It would take around 2,000 days, or about 5.5 years, to crack the
password.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_problems_with_password_encrypted_backups">4.2.2. Problems with password-encrypted backups</h4>

When the app asks John for a password, he needs to produce one on the
spot. He doesn’t have time to flip a coin 48 times to produce a good
password. He will most likely make up something with far less entropy.
One way to deal with this is to have the wallet give John a generated
password. But this password is likely harder to remember than a
self-invented password, which will increase the likelihood of a
forgotten password.</p>

<p>One of the brighter developers at the company, a cryptographer, comes

</div>
<div class="paragraph important">
<p>She realizes that if all private keys in a wallet were generated from
a single random number called a <em>random seed</em>, the whole wallet
could be backed up by writing down the seed on a piece of paper and

<p>She talks to some other cryptographers, and they decide on a strategy.
They’re going to make an HD wallet. Basically, keys are organized as a
tree, in which one key is the root of the tree, and this root can have
any number of child keys. Each child key can in turn have a large
number of children of its own, and so on.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>BIP44, Multi-Account Hierarchy for Deterministic Wallets, describes
which branches of the tree are used for which purposes. For now, let’s
use Rita’s chosen key organization.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose Rita wants to organize her keys based on their purpose and
generate five keys to use for shopping at the cafe and another three
keys to use as a savings account. <a href="#fig0408">Figure 8</a> shows how her keys could
be organized.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 8. Rita creates two accounts, with five addresses in the shopping account and three addresses in the savings account.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The keys are organized as a tree, but it’s a tree turned upside down
because that’s how computer geeks typically draw their trees. Anyway,
the root key of the tree (at the top) is called the <em>master private
key</em>. It’s the key from which all the rest of the keys are
derived. The master private key has two <em>child keys</em>: one that
represents the shopping account (left, in <a href="#fig0408">Figure 8</a>) and one that
represents the savings account (right). Each of these children has, in
turn, its own children. The shopping account key has five children,
and the savings account key has three children. These eight children
have no children of their own, which is why they’re called <em>leaves</em> of
the tree. The leaves are the private keys Rita uses to store cookie
tokens, so an address is generated from each of these eight private
keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock gbinfo">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Indexes</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computer programmers often use the term <em>index</em> to denote a position
in a list. It’s usually zero-based, meaning the first item in the list
has index 0, the second item has index 1, and so on. We’ll use
zero-based indexes throughout this book.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note how the keys in the tree are numbered. Each set of children is
numbered from 0 and upwards. This is used to give each key a unique
identifier. For example the first, <em>index</em> 0, savings key is denoted
<code>m/1/0</code>. <code>m</code> is special and refers to the master private key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How is a tree structure like this accomplished? Let’s look closer at
the creation of some parts of the tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Three important processes are performed to create the tree, as

<p>The private key is indistinguishable from an old-type private key
generated directly from a random number generator. You can use it to
derive a public key and a cookie token address. You usually make
addresses only out of leaves, but you could use internal keys as well.
The other part of the xprv is the chain code. A chain code is the
rightmost 256 bits of a 512-bit hash, hence the right-half hash icon
in the figure. You’ll see soon how that hash is created. The chain
code’s purpose is to provide entropy when generating a child xprv. The
master xprv doesn’t differ from other xprvs, but we give it a special
name because it’s the ancestor of all keys in the tree. It is,
however, created differently.</p>

<p>In step 1, the random seed is created in the same way as when you

bits of random data, but it could just as well be 256 bits depending
on the level of security you want—128 bits are enough for most users.
You’ll see later how the choice of seed size will affect the backup
process; a longer seed means more writing on a piece of paper during
backup. We’ll get back to this in <a href="#back-to-backup">Section 4.5</a>.</p>

<p>To create the master private key, the seed is hashed using HMAC-SHA512

From a user’s perspective, you can regard HMAC-SHA512 as a normal
cryptographic hash function but with multiple inputs. The hash value
is split into the left 256 bits and the right 256 bits. The left 256
bits become the master private key, which is a normal private key;
it’s called the <em>master</em> private key because all other private keys
are derived from this single private key (and the chain code). The

<p>Rita’s wallet used to create a seed using a random number generator,

<p>The output from each function is added using bitwise XOR (exclusive

<p>The checksum is pretty weak—4 bits make only 16 possible checksums. A

<p>Rita created her wallet from a random 128-bit seed, which she backed
up with a 12-word mnemonic sentence. Her wallet can create any number
of private keys from that seed. She can organize them into different
“accounts” as she pleases. Very nice. But HD wallets have another
feature: you can create a tree of public keys and chain codes without
knowing any of the private keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose the cafe uses an HD wallet. It wants to start selling cookies on
its website and delivering those cookies to coworkers’ cubicles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For privacy reasons, the web server needs to be able to present a new
cookie token address for every sale, but where does it get the
addresses? The cafe could create an xprv for an <em>online sales</em>
account in its HD wallet and put that xprv on the web server, as
<a href="#fig0418">Figure 18</a> shows.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The web server can now create new addresses as the orders pour in.
Great! But what if Mallory, the gangster, gains access to the web
server’s hard drive? She can steal all the money in any of the addresses
in the online sales account. She can’t steal from any other addresses in
the tree. For example, she can’t calculate any key in the <em>counter
sales</em> account because she doesn’t have access to the master xprv, which
is needed to calculate the counter sales account key and all its
children.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typical web servers are prone to hacking attempts because they’re
usually accessible from anywhere in the world. Storing money on the
web server would probably attract a lot of hacking attempts. Sooner or
later, someone would succeed in getting access to the web server’s
hard drive, and steal the xprv.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this reason, the cafe wants to avoid having any private keys on
the web server. Thanks to the HD wallet, this is possible by using
xpubs (<a href="#fig0419">Figure 19</a>).</p>

<div class="title">Figure 19. An xpub consists of a public key and a chain code.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An xpub is similar to an xprv, but the xpub contains a public key and
a chain code, whereas the xprv contains a private key and a chain
code. An xprv shares the chain code with the xpub. You can create an
xpub from an xprv, but you can’t create the xprv from the xpub. This
is because public key derivation is a one-way function; a public key
can be derived from a private key, but a private key can’t be derived
from a public key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cafe puts the xpub <code>M/1</code> on the web server. By convention, we use
<code>M</code> to denote an xpub path and <code>m</code> to denote an xprv path. <code>M/1</code> and
<code>m/1</code> have the same chain code, but <code>M/1</code> doesn’t have the private key,
only the public key. You can create the whole xpub tree from the master
xpub (<a href="#fig0420">Figure 20</a>), which means you can generate any and all addresses
without any private key. You can create addresses, but not spend money
from those addresses.</p>

<p>This looks exactly like when you generated the tree of xprvs. The
difference is that you have no private keys. As <a href="#fig0421">Figure 21</a> shows, the

<p>This resembles xprv derivation. The difference is what you do with the
left 256 bits of the 512-bit hash. To calculate the child public key,
you treat the left 256 bits as if they were a private key and derive a
public key from them. This public key is then added to the parent
public key using the special <em>public key addition</em> operation. The
result is the child public key. Let’s compare the child public key
derivation to the child private key derivation (<a href="#fig0422">Figure 22</a>) from the
point after generating the left 256 bits of the HMAC-SHA512 hash.</p>

<p>Normal addition is used for the private key. You add a 256-bit number
to the parent private key to get the child private key. But to keep
the result within 256-bit numbers, you use addition <em>modulo</em> 2<sup>256</sup>.</p>

<p>The addition used to derive the child public key isn’t exactly what most
people (including me) are used to. For now, let’s just say this addition
works. We’ll dig deeper into that in <a href="#public-key-math">Section 4.8</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cafe’s online business works well. People are ordering cookies
like crazy! The online sales account grows, with a new public key for
every order. The xpub for the online sales account sits on the web
server, and the xprv is present only in the cafe’s wallet (and in a
locked-away mnemonic sentence).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose Mallory somehow steals the private key <code>m/1/1</code>, which contains
only 10 CT. This might seem harmless because that private key has so
little money in it. But it could be worse than that. If Mallory has
also managed to get the xpub for the online sales account from the web

<p>Mallory has everything she needs to calculate the left-half hash for any

stolen private key has, so she starts testing with index 0:</p>

<p>This private key derives to the public key <code>M/1</code>. Bingo! She has
calculated the private key <code>m/1</code> for the online sales account. The xprv
shares the chain code with the xpub, so she also has the xprv for <code>m/1</code>,
and she can calculate the private key tree for the account. Mallory
steals all the money from the online sales account. Not good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now think about what would happen if Mallory had the master xpub. She
could use the same technique to derive the master xprv from the master
xpub and <code>m/1/1</code>. Mallory can re-create all the private keys of all
accounts in the entire wallet. Can you do something to prevent such a
catastrophic scenario? Yes, with <em>yet another key-derivation
function</em>! This new key-derivation function is called <em>hardened xprv
derivation</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose the cafe wants to prevent Mallory from accessing the master
xprv, even if she got the master xpub and a private key in the online

<p>The apostrophe in <code>m/1'</code> isn’t a typo: it’s used to denote hardened
key derivation. The difference is that with hardened key derivation,
you hash the <em>private</em> key instead of the public key. An attacker
can’t do the “minus” trick anymore because the hash is derived from
the parent private key. Mallory can’t calculate the left-half hash to
subtract from the child private key because she doesn’t have the
parent private key. <a href="#fig0425">Figure 25</a> illustrates the result.</p>

<p>This also means you can’t derive a hardened child xpub from a parent
xpub. You must have the parent xprv to generate any children, public
or private. The children of <code>m/1'</code> can’t be derived as hardened
private keys because that would require the cafe to put the private
key <code>m/1'</code> on the online sales web server, which would be
insecure. Using nonhardened leaf keys in the online sales account
makes the cafe vulnerable to an attacker stealing <code>m/1'/1</code> and
<code>M/1'</code>. If that happens, all funds in the account will be stolen. With
hardened xprv, you solve the case of a stolen <code>M</code> and <code>m/1'/1</code> but not
the case with a stolen <code>M/1'</code> and <code>m/1'/1</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The previous equations are examples of a class of equations called
<em>elliptic curves</em>, and a solution is often referred to as a <em>point
on the curve</em>. You can now calculate a public key, which is a point
on the curve, from a private key. To do this, start at a special
point, \(G=(6,5)\), on the curve. \(G\) is somewhat arbitrarily
chosen, but it’s widely known by everybody to be the starting point
for public key derivation. <em>The public key is the private key
multiplied by \(G\).</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose your private key is \(5\). Then your public key is \(5G\).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To calculate this multiplication, you need two basic public key
operations: addition and doubling, where doubling can be seen as
adding a point to itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To add two points (<a href="#fig0427">Figure 27</a>), you draw a straight line that “wraps
around” the edges of the diagram and that intersects your two points
and one third point. This third point is the negative result of the
addition. To get the final result of the addition, take the symmetric
point at the same \(x\) value.</p>

<p>The result of \((6, 5) + (2, 2)\) is \((7, 8)\). The straight

complement point to \((7, 3)\) is \((7, 8)\), which is the
result of the addition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To double a point (<a href="#fig0428">Figure 28</a>) is to add it to itself, but there’s no
slope to be calculated from a single point. In this special case, you
calculate the slope from the single point \(P=(6,5)\) as
\(3*x^2*(2y)^{-1} \mod{11} = 2\). The process is almost the same as
adding two different points, but you calculate the slope of the line
differently.</p>

special case, both these points will use <code>02</code> because 0 is even.</p>

<p>Let’s look back at what you’ve learned in this chapter. An HD wallet
generates a tree of keys from a random seed. It can use key hardening
to isolate different branches of the tree from each other.</p>

<p>The cafe accepts cookie tokens in its online shop. It only puts the
xpub for the online sales account, <code>M/1'</code>, on the web server, which
can now create as many addresses as needed without using any private
keys. The private keys are kept in the cafe’s wallet and never touch
the web server.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You usually use a mobile app, called a wallet, to send and receive
money—cookie tokens or bitcoins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wallet creates and stores keys, scans or shows payment details,
sends payments, shows your balance, and backs up keys. You don’t have to
do any of this manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backups are hard to do right. Password-protected backups suffer from
problems with forgotten passwords, technology improvements, and humans
being lousy random number generators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With HD wallets, you back up your random seed and store that seed in a
safe place. Do it only once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The seed can be encoded using a mnemonic sentence, which makes it easier
to write down the seed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HD wallets generate multiple private keys from a seed and organize them
in a tree structure to improve privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tree of public keys—or any of its branches—can be generated from an
xpub. This is useful for insecure environments such as web servers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardened private key derivation keeps “accounts” compartmental­ized. It
confines an attacker to a single account.</p>
