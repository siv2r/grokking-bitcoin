<p>The goal of this book is to teach you enough about Bitcoin to make
informed decisions about how you can use it to improve your private life
or business. My hope is that you’ll learn enough to make up your own

<div class="sidebarblock inbitcoin">

<div class="title">Bitcoin or bitcoin?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system is named <em>Bitcoin</em> with a capital B. The currency unit is
called a <em>bitcoin</em> with a lowercase b. Commonly used symbols for
bitcoins are <span class="image btc"><img src="images/common/btc-sans.svg" alt="BTC"></span>, BTC, and XBT. We’ll mostly use BTC in this book.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bitcoin is a digital cash system. It allows for people to move bitcoins,
the currency unit of Bitcoin, between each other without using a bank or
any other trusted third party. It resembles traditional bank notes and
coins, but it’s purely digital and used over the internet. The Bitcoin
currency isn’t tied to any specific <em>fiat currency</em> like the US dollar
or the Chinese renminbi; it has free-floating exchange rates against
most fiat currencies. You can buy and sell bitcoins for fiat currencies
online using one of several exchanges, such as kraken.com, bitstamp.net,
or localbitcoins.com.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No government or company controls Bitcoin. Instead, thousands of
computers around the globe—the <em>Bitcoin network</em>, shown in
<a href="#actors">Figure 1</a>—collectively keep the system working 24/7. You don’t need
to register or sign up anywhere to use Bitcoin, you just need internet
access and a computer program, like a mobile app, to use it.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin network’s job is to process Bitcoin payments, secure the
ledger of who owns what from unauthorized modifications, and get new
bitcoins into circulation at the predetermined rate. The network
consists of thousands of computers around the world. We call these
computers <em>Bitcoin nodes</em>, or just <em>nodes</em>. Any of the actors
mentioned previously can also participate actively in the Bitcoin
network by running their own Bitcoin node. You must run your own node if
you don’t want to trust others to provide you with correct financial
information.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin network is a network of computers running Bitcoin
software.  This network verifies and confirms payments between Bitcoin
users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose Alice wants to make a payment of 1 BTC to Bob. The payment
starts with Alice creating a transaction and sending it to the Bitcoin
network, as shown in <a href="#payment-overview">Figure 2</a>. I outline the process’s
four steps here and explain each step further in the following
subsections. <a href="#payment-overview">Figure 2</a> will appear in the introduction of
chapters 2 through 8, where I’ll point out which part of the figure
we’ll cover in the chapter.</p>

</div>
<div class="olist arabic">

<li>
<p>Alice creates and signs a transaction that moves 1 bitcoin from her to
Bob. She then sends the transaction to the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>The computers in the network—the Bitcoin nodes—check that Alice actually
has the money to spend and that the transaction is authentic. They then
pass the transaction to their neighbors, called <em>peers</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each computer updates its own copy of the <em>Bitcoin blockchain</em>, or the
<em>ledger</em>, with the new payment information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network notifies Bob that he has received 1 bitcoin.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note how Alice does not really <em>send</em> 1 bitcoin to Bob, but asks the
Bitcoin network to move 1 bitcoin from Alice to Bob in the Bitcoin
blockchain.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin blockchain is a database that each computer in the Bitcoin
network has a copy of. Think of the blockchain as a ledger of all
transactions ever made.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Step 1 of the process (<a href="#bitcoin-payment">Figure 3</a>) is when Alice asks the
network to move 1 bitcoin to Bob. She does this by sending a Bitcoin
transaction to the Bitcoin network. This transaction contains
instructions on how to move the money and a digital signature that
proves it’s really Alice requesting that the money be moved.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alice has sent a transaction to one or more Bitcoin nodes. In step 2
of the process (<a href="#overview-bitcoin-network">Figure 4</a>), each such node checks
that the transaction is valid and passes it on to its peers. It does
this by consulting its local copy of the blockchain and verifying that</p>

<div class="title">Invalid transactions</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Invalid transactions are dropped. They won’t reach further than the first node.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If all checks pass, a node forwards the transaction to its peers in
the Bitcoin network. This is known as <em>relaying</em>. Alice’s
transaction will shortly have traveled the entire network while each
node verifies it along the way. The blockchain hasn’t been updated
yet; that’s the next step.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="step-3-the-blockchain">1.2.3. Step 3: The blockchain</h4>
<div class="sidebarblock inbitcoin">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">The blockchain</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The name <em>blockchain</em> comes from how the ledger is structured. It uses
blocks that are chained together in such a way that modifications to the
blockchain can be detected. I’ll have more on that in <a href="#ch06">[ch06]</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In step 3, nodes update their local copies of the Bitcoin blockchain
with Alice’s transaction. The blockchain contains historic information
about all previous transactions; new transactions, such as Alice’s, are
appended to it every now and then.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Updating the blockchain with Alice’s transaction isn’t as
straightforward as it might seem. Alice’s transaction isn’t the only
one going on in the Bitcoin network. Potentially thousands of
transactions can be in flight at the same time. If all nodes updated
their copy of the blockchain as they received transactions, the copies
wouldn’t remain copies for long because transactions can come in
different orders on different nodes, as <a href="#txs-unordered">Figure 5</a> shows.</p>
</div>
<div id="txs-unordered" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch01/01-05.svg" alt="01 05" width="75%">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 5. Transactions arrive in different orders at different nodes. If all nodes wrote their transactions to the blockchain in order of arrival, the different nodes’ blockchains would differ.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To coordinate the ordering of transactions, one node takes the lead,
saying “I want to add these two transactions to the blockchain in the
order Y, X!” This message, known as a <em>block</em>, is sent out on the
network by that leader (<a href="#step-3">Figure 6</a>), in the same way that Alice sent the
transaction.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-3" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch01/01-06.svg" alt="01 06" width="75%">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 6. One node takes the lead and tells the others in what order to add transactions. The other nodes verify the block and update their blockchain copies accordingly.</div>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock gbinfo">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">The blockchain is append-only</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>New transactions are added to the end of the blockchain only—it grows
only from the end.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As nodes see this block, they update their copy of the blockchain
according to the message and pass the block on to their peers. Alice’s
transaction was one of the transactions in the block and is now part of
the blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why would a node want to take the lead? The node that takes the lead is
rewarded with newly minted bitcoins and transaction fees paid by the
transactions it includes in the block.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But wouldn’t every node constantly take the lead to collect the
rewards? No, because to take the lead, a node must solve a hard problem.
This requires the node to consume considerable time and electricity,
which ensures that leaders don’t pop up often. The problem is so hard
that most nodes in the network don’t even try. Nodes that do try are
called <em>miners</em> because they mine new coins, similar to a gold miner
digging for gold. We’ll discuss this process further in <a href="#ch07">[ch07]</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="overview-wallets">1.2.4. Step 4: Wallets</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bob and Alice are Bitcoin network users, and they both need a computer
program to interact with the network. Such a program is called a
<em>Bitcoin wallet</em>. Several types of Bitcoin wallets are available for
different devices, such as mobile phones and desktop computers, and
there are even specialized hardware wallet devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before step 4 of the payment process, the nodes in the network update
their local copy of the blockchain. Now, the network needs to notify
Alice and Bob that the transaction went through, as
<a href="#wallet-connection">Figure 7</a> shows.</p>
</div>
<div id="wallet-connection" class="imageblock">

<div class="title">Figure 7. Bob’s wallet has asked a node to notify the wallet upon activity at Bob’s Bitcoin address. Alice pays to Bob’s address, and the node has just written the transaction to the blockchain, so it notifies Bob’s wallet.</div>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bob’s wallet is connected to some of the nodes in the Bitcoin network.
When a transaction concerning Bob is added to the blockchain, the
nodes that Bob’s wallet is connected to will notify Bob’s wallet. The
wallet will then display a message to Bob that he received 1
bitcoin. Alice also uses a wallet. Her wallet will be notified of her
own transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides sending and receiving transactions, Bob’s and Alice’s wallets
also manage their private keys for them. As described earlier, a
private key is used to create digital signatures, as well as to
generate a Bitcoin address. Alice created her digital signature with
one of her private keys. When Bob later wants to spend the money he
received at his Bitcoin address, which he generated from his private
key, he needs to create a transaction and digitally sign it with that
private key.</p>

<p>Bitcoin wouldn’t be this widespread if it didn’t solve real problems
for real people. Bitcoin solves several problems inherent to the
traditional financial system. Let’s look at some commonly discussed
problem areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_segregation">1.3.1. Segregation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People with bank accounts and access to banking services such as
online payments or loans are privileged. According to the World Bank,
about 38% of the world’s population doesn’t have a bank account (see
<a href="#web-financial-inclusion">[web-financial-inclusion]</a>). The numbers are slowly improving, but
many people are still stuck in a cash-only environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without a bank account and basic banking services, such as online
payments, people can’t expand their businesses outside their local
communities. A merchant won’t be able to offer goods or services on
the internet to increase its customer base. A person living in a rural
area might have to travel half a day to pay a utility bill or top up
their prepaid mobile phone.</p>

<p>This segregation between banked people and unbanked people is driven

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Banking services are too expensive for some people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To use banking services, you need documentation, such as an ID card,
that many people don’t have.</p>

donations through traditional channels were blocked after pressure
from the US government on the major payment networks, such as Visa and
Mastercard (see <a href="#web-wikileaks-blockade">[web-wikileaks-blockade]</a>). We’ve also seen how
Cyprus seized 47.5% of all bank deposits exceeding 100,000 € as part
of a financial rescue program in 2013 (<a href="#web-cyprus-seizure">[web-cyprus-seizure]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that bank notes and coins usually aren’t affected. As long as
there is cash, people can trade freely and privately. In some parts of
the world—for example, Sweden—cash is being phased out, which means
soon you won’t be able to buy chewing gum without someone recording
your transaction.</p>

<p>Most currencies are subject to inflation, some more than others. For
example, the Zimbabwean dollar inflated nearly 10<sup>23</sup>% from 2007–2008,
peaking at 80 billion percent per month during a few months in 2008.
That’s an average daily inflation rate of nearly 100%. Prices roughly
doubled every day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Extreme cases of inflation like this are called <em>hyperinflation</em>,
and are usually driven by a rapid increase in the money
supply. Governments sometimes increase the money supply as a tool to
extract value from the population and pay for expenses such as the
national debt, warfare, or welfare. If this tool is overused, the risk
of hyperinflation is apparent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A rapid increase in the money supply will most likely lead to a
depreciation of a country’s currency. This, in turn, pushes people to
exchange their local currency for goods or alternative currencies that
better hold value, which further drives down the value of the local
currency. This can spiral to extremes, as in Zimbabwe. The result is
devastating for people as they see their life savings diminish to
virtually nothing. <a href="#inflation-table">Table 1</a> shows examples of recent
hyperinflations.</p>

<h3 id="_the_bitcoin_approach">1.4. The Bitcoin approach</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bitcoin offers a fundamentally different model than traditional
financial institutions. Let’s explore the major differences one
by one.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="decentralized">1.4.1. Decentralized</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of a central organization such as the US Federal Reserve
controlling the currency, control of Bitcoin is distributed among
thousands of computers, or nodes. No single node or group of nodes has
more privileges or obligations than any other. This equality between
nodes makes Bitcoin <em>decentralized</em>, as opposed to <em>centralized</em>
systems, such as banks or the Google search engine
(<a href="#centalized-decentralized">Figure 9</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a centralized system, the service is controlled by a single entity,
such as a bank. This single entity can decide who gets to use the
service and what the user is allowed to do. For example, an online video
service can choose to provide a video only to people in a certain
geographical location.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a decentralized system such as Bitcoin, which has several
thousands of nodes spread around the globe, it’s extremely hard to
control who uses the system and how. No matter where or who they are, or
to whom they’re sending money, the Bitcoin system will treat all users
equally. The Bitcoin system has no central point that can be exploited
to censor payments, deny users service, or seize funds.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph important">
<p>As mentioned, Bitcoin is permissionless, which means you don’t need to
ask anyone for permission to participate. Anyone with a computer and an
internet connection can set up a Bitcoin node and take an active role in
the Bitcoin network—no questions asked, no registration required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Changing the rules of Bitcoin is nearly impossible without broad
consensus. If a node doesn’t obey the rules, the rest of the nodes will
ignore it. For example, one rule is that Bitcoin’s money supply is
limited to 21 million bitcoins. This limit is nearly impossible to
change because of decentralization; there’s no one you can threaten or
bribe to change these rules.</p>

every so often by a company or state. Bitcoin is resistant to high
inflation because you can’t increase the money supply at will.</p>

experience is the same: money is sent directly to the recipient, who
sees the payment nearly instantaneously. Within about 60 minutes, this

transfer can’t be reversed without the recipient’s consent.</p>

<p>So far, we’ve touched on a few common use cases for Bitcoin. This
section will dig deeper into those use cases and a few others. It’s
hard to predict what use cases we’ll see in the future, so let’s stick
to what we know now.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One interesting Bitcoin feature is that you keep your money safe by
storing a set of private keys: the secret pieces of information you’ll
need when you want to spend your money. You choose how those private
keys are stored. You can write them on paper, or you can store them
electronically with a mobile app to have easy access to them. You can
also memorize your private keys. These keys are all anyone needs to
spend your money. Keep them safe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Savings is an attractive use case for Bitcoin. A simple way to save is
to create a private key and write it down on a piece of paper that you
store in a safe. This piece of paper is now your savings account, your
savings wallet. You can then send bitcoins to your wallet. As long as
your private key is kept safe, your money is safe. You can choose from
a lot of different saving schemes to find the right balance between
security and convenience. For example, you can keep your keys
unencrypted in your mobile phone for easy access or store them
encrypted on paper in a vault with armed guards.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_cross_border_payments">1.5.2. Cross-border payments</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted, moving money from one country to another is expensive (say,
15%), especially if you move money to a poor country, and the
recipient doesn’t have a bank account. It’s becoming increasingly
popular to use Bitcoin to circumvent this expensive and slow legacy
system. It’s usually cheaper to exchange Swedish crowns for bitcoins
in Sweden and transfer the bitcoins to your friend in the
Philippines. Your friend will then exchange the bitcoins locally for
Philippine pesos.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some companies offer services so that you pay Swedish crowns to the
company and the company pays out Philippine pesos to your friend
(<a href="#remittance-company">Figure 12</a>). You won’t even know that Bitcoin is used
under the hood. Such companies typically charge a few percent for the
service, but it will still be cheaper than traditional remittance
services.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 12. A remittance company uses Bitcoin to transfer money from Sweden to the Philippines.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, if recipients can make good use of Bitcoin where they live,
there’s no need for a middleman that takes a cut of the money. You can
send bitcoins directly to your friend. This is what Bitcoin is all
about. Exchanges and other such service companies are just bridges
between the old legacy world and the new Bitcoin world.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most obvious use case for Bitcoin is shopping. Bitcoin’s
borderlessness and security make it ideal for online payments for
goods and services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In traditional online payments, you send your debit card details to
the merchant and <em>hope</em> the merchant will withdraw as much as you
agreed on.  You also <em>hope</em> the merchant handles your debit card
details with great care. They probably store the details in a
database. Think about that: for every debit card purchase you make,
your card details will be stored in that merchant’s database. It’s
likely that <em>one</em> of the databases will be hacked and your card
details stolen. The more merchants store your details, the higher the
risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With Bitcoin, you don’t have that problem because you don’t send any
sensitive information to the merchant, or anyone else. You transfer
the amount of money you agreed on and nothing more.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="speculation">1.5.4. Speculation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The world is full of people wanting to get rich quick. Bitcoin can be
alluring to them because of its price <em>volatility</em>, or tendency to
change. Looking at the history of bitcoin’s price, as shown in
<a href="#btc-price">Figure 13</a>, it’s tempting to try to buy when it’s low and sell when
it’s high.</p>
</div>
<div id="btc-price" class="imageblock movingtarget">

<div class="title">Figure 13. Price in USD since the beginning of Bitcoin</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph movingtarget">
<p>In November 2013, the price climbed from about $100 USD to more than
$1100 in a few weeks. This was clearly a so-called <em>bubble</em>, in which
people were afraid of missing out on a great rise, so they bought in,
driving the price further up, until it eventually started dropping
again. The drop to 50% of its peak value was just as quick as its rise.
The same pattern repeated in late 2017 but at a greater magnitude. This
has happened many times already. Fluctuations like this are rarely
driven by any specific news or technological advancement, but usually
arise from speculation. Speculation can be fun, if you can afford to
lose, but it’s more like a lottery than something to make a living from.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes a government or big corporation makes a negative statement
about Bitcoin that creates fear in the market, but those events tend to
have a limited effect on bitcoin’s value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bitcoin’s price volatility seems contradictory to the claims of it
having a non-inflationary property; a 50% drop in market value appears
pretty inflationary. Bitcoin is still relatively new, and lots of
short-term speculation causes this volatility. But as Bitcoin grows and
more people and institutions start using it to store their wealth, it
will probably stabilize in the long run, and its deflationary property
will emerge over time.</p>

<p>Bitcoin lets you embed small pieces of data with payments. This data

new car owner, containing the chassis number. This payment will then
represent the transfer of ownership for that car.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bitcoin payments are public records, but they aren’t tied to people in
any way. They’re tied to long strings of numbers called <em>public
keys</em>, explained in detail in <a href="#ch02">[ch02]</a>. The car manufacturer has made
its public key available on its website, in newspapers, and in
advertisements to tie the key to the manufacturer’s identity. Anyone
can then verify that the manufacturer has transferred ownership of the
car to the new owner. The new owner can show that she owns the car by
proving that she owns the private key belonging to the public key to
which the manufacturer has transferred ownership.</p>

supply is low. But the demand is high because people want to escape
their hyperinflating currency. These factors drive the Bitcoin price up
in that market compared to, for example, the US and European markets,
where people can trade more freely.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Bitcoin transaction should usually include a processing fee. This fee
isn’t related to the amount sent but to how big the transaction is in
bytes. This is because the Bitcoin network’s cost for processing a
transaction depends mostly on how big (in bytes) the transaction is.
High-value transactions aren’t bigger (in bytes) than low-value
transactions, so the fee is about the same for both kinds of
transactions. The fee required for a transaction also depends on supply
and demand for available space in the blockchain. The blockchain can’t
handle more than roughly 12 MB of transactions per hour, which means
miners sometimes have to prioritize transactions. Paying a higher fee
will probably give your transaction a higher priority.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the fee is a significant share of the actual payment you want to
make, it isn’t economically viable to pay with ordinary Bitcoin
transactions (see <a href="#fee-feasibility">Table 3</a>).</p>

<p>But promising emerging technologies are being built on top of Bitcoin.
One example is the Lightning Network, which allows for cheap,
instantaneous micropayments of tiny fractions of a bitcoin. Using the
Lightning Network, you could potentially pay just 100 satoshis (where
1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC) at a fee of as little as 1 satoshi.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_instant_payments">Instant payments</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bitcoin payments take time to confirm. The recipient sees the payment
immediately but shouldn’t trust the payment until the Bitcoin network
confirms it, which typically happens within 20 minutes. Trusting an
unconfirmed transaction can be risky; the sender can <em>double spend</em> the
bitcoins by sending the same bitcoins in another transaction to another
Bitcoin address—for example, the sender’s.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The confirmation time can add friction in brick-and-mortar shops because
customers don’t want to wait 20 minutes before getting their coffee.
This might not be a big issue in some online shops, where the shop can
wait 20 minutes before sending the goods to the customer; but some
online services, such as pay-per-view, could find the confirmation time
problematic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This limitation can also be fixed by systems built on top of Bitcoin—for
example, the Lightning Network—especially when the payment amount is
small.</p>

<p>This book will cover Bitcoin, but several other so-called
<em>crypto­currencies</em> exist, and new ones pop up all the time.
Cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin are often referred to as
<em>alt-coins</em>, meaning <em>alternative coins</em>. I’ll list a few alt-coins
along with their purpose and market capitalization, or <em>market cap</em>
(<a href="#altcoins-table">Table 4</a>). The market cap is the product of the money supply (number
of coins) and the current market price per coin. Note that the market
cap will most likely have changed a lot by the time you read this. I

position relative to other cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>I encourage you to look up these cryptocurrencies, because they all
provide interesting new features beyond Bitcoin. Hundreds of other
alt-coins exist. Some, such as those in the table, provide unique
features that aren’t available in Bitcoin, and others provide little to
nothing innovative. Some alt-coins may even be outright scams. Stay

<p>Anyone can create an alt-coin by taking existing cryptocurrency software
and modifying it to their needs.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s say Sheila wants to start an alt-coin, Wowcoin. She takes the
Bitcoin software and changes the maximum money supply to 11,000,000,
instead of Bitcoin’s 21,000,000 coins. When she starts Wowcoin, Sheila
will be lonely because no one else is using her alt-coin. If she wants
Wowcoin to have some real value, she must convince other people to begin
using it. If she’s not providing anything innovative, she’s going to
have a hard time getting other people on board, because they’re pretty
happy with what Bitcoin already provides. Everybody else is using
Bitcoin, so why would you use Wowcoin? Think of it as starting a new
internet that you call Wownet. People on Wownet won’t be able to use
services on the internet. Conversely, people on the internet won’t be
able to use your service if you’re on Wownet. So why would anyone use
Wownet? We call this the <em>network effect</em> (see <a href="#network-effect">Figure 14</a>)—people tend
to go where other people are.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Bitcoin is global, borderless money that anyone with an internet

<li>
<p>Many different actors use Bitcoin, including savers, merchants, and
traders for various purposes, such as payments, remittances, and

<li>
<p>A network of computers, the Bitcoin network, verifies and keeps records
