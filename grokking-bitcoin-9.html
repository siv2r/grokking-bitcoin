<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’re now past the core chapters of the book, in which you learned the
Bitcoin basics. In this chapter, we’ll dig deeper into the
functionality transactions can offer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ll start by exploring time locks. A <em>time lock</em> is a way to make a
transaction invalid until some point in time. This means the
transaction can’t be confirmed before that time constraint
is met. Also, an output of a transaction can be programmed to prevent
it from being spent until a time constraint is fulfilled. This is
useful for digital contracts, such as atomic swaps, covered later in
this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s sometimes useful to store a small amount of data in a transaction
in the blockchain. For example, a car manufacturer might want to track
ownership of a car by putting its chassis number into a Bitcoin
transaction, effectively creating a token on the Bitcoin
blockchain. The current owner can then transfer ownership of the car
by sending that token to the new owner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned in <a href="#altcoins">[altcoins]</a>, several alternative cryptocurrencies are
available. Sometimes, you might want to trade, for example, namecoins
for bitcoins. The most obvious way to do this is to use an exchange to
sell bitcoins and buy namecoins. But there are other, more
decentralized ways to do it. <em>Atomic swaps</em> let you swap bitcoins
directly with someone holding namecoins without a trusted third party,
like an exchange.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you pay a too-small transaction fee, miners might refuse to confirm
the transaction within a reasonable time. In this situation, it can be
helpful to replace the transaction with another one that pays a little
more in fees. This is known as <em>fee-bumping</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we’ll explore some intricate details of signatures. You can
create signatures in different ways depending on your use case. You
can tune what the signature should commit to: in other words, change
how the signing algorithm hashes the transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="time-locked-transactions">9.1. Time-locked transactions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you create and sign a transaction, it’s valid and ready for
inclusion in any future block. You can broadcast it immediately and have
it mined. This is the normal case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But in some cases, you may want to sign a transaction with a guarantee
that it won’t be mined until after at least, say, one year has passed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose you have 100 bitcoins, and you want your daughter to inherit the
money to her address @<sub>D</sub>, but only after you die. You can create a
transaction that’s time-locked (<a href="#fig0901">Figure 1</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock gbinfo">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">No fee?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the sake of simplicity, most examples in this chapter don’t pay
any fees.</p>

<div class="title">Sequence numbers</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sequence numbers are always included in inputs, but I haven’t shown
them because they didn’t matter to the transactions used so far.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What makes this transaction special are the inputs’ sequence numbers and
the transaction lock time. I briefly mentioned sequence numbers in
<a href="#ch05">[ch05]</a>. They’re used to enable the lock time: if any input has a
sequence number less than <code>ffffffff</code>—for example, <code>fffffffe</code>—the lock
time set on the transaction will be effective. If all sequence numbers
are <code>ffffffff</code>, the lock time won’t have any effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You give this transaction, Tx<sub>1</sub>, to your daughter. It’s currently
invalid; your daughter stores it on her computer and prints a backup
that she keeps in another place. It isn’t broadcast; no full node will
accept a block containing this transaction yet. The transaction will
become valid the morning of 30 April 2019. If you die before that, your
daughter must wait until after the lock-time date and then claim the
money by broadcasting the transaction, which will have become valid by
then.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don’t die before that date, you want to make sure the time-locked
transaction becomes useless so your daughter can’t take the money once
the date has passed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can create, but not yet broadcast, a new transaction, Tx<sub>2</sub>, that
double spends an output that Tx<sub>1</sub> spends (<a href="#fig0902">Figure 2</a>). You then
create a new transaction, time-locked for yet another year, for your
daugher.  When she’s stored the transaction safely, you broadcast Tx2.</p>

<div class="content">
<div class="title">Transaction malleability</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There’s a problem here. The txid of Tx<sub>2</sub> <em>can</em> change while being
broadcast, making Tx<sub>3</sub> forever invalid. This is called <em>transaction
malleability</em> and is fixed by using segregated witness as discussed in
<a href="#ch10">[ch10]</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need to</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Create and sign a transaction, Tx<sub>2</sub>, that spends at least one of
the outputs spent by Tx<sub>1</sub>. Tx<sub>2</sub> is a normal, not time-locked,
transaction.  Don’t broadcast this transaction just yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new time-locked transaction, Tx<sub>3</sub>, that spends all your
outputs as if Tx<sub>2</sub> was confirmed. Tx<sub>3</sub> is locked for another year.<br>
Give it to your daughter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broadcast Tx<sub>2</sub>. Once Tx<sub>2</sub> is mined, Tx<sub>1</sub> will become forever
invalid because one of the inputs of Tx<sub>1</sub> is spent by Tx<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note how the order of events is important here. If Tx<sub>2</sub> is broadcast
<em>before</em> you give Tx<sub>3</sub> to your daughter, there’s a chance you’ll die
before giving her Tx<sub>3</sub>. Then, your daughter won’t be able to receive
the funds because she has no valid transaction to claim them with. Tx<sub>1</sub>
is invalidated by Tx<sub>2</sub> in the blockchain, and Tx<sub>3</sub> isn’t in your
daughter’s possession.</p>

<h4 id="_time_measurements">9.1.1. Time measurements</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can express a lock time in two ways. The first is by setting a date
and time as in the previous example. The second is to set a block
height.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_block_time">Block time</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first example expressed the lock time as a date and time. This means
the <em>median time past</em> must be greater than the lock time in the
transaction. In <a href="#ch07">[ch07]</a>, I noted that a block’s timestamp must be
greater than the past 11 blocks’ median timestamp, or the <em>median time
past</em> of the block. We use the median time past to decide whether a
transaction is valid as regards the lock time. Suppose you died on 24
January 2019. Your mourning daughter wouldn’t be able to claim your
money until 30 April 2019. <a href="#fig0903">Figure 3</a> illustrates this more precisely.</p>
</div>
<div id="fig0903" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch09/09-03.svg" alt="09 03" width="100%">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 3. Your daughter can claim your money after the median time past is earlier than your lock time.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your daughter’s transaction can’t be mined in any block before the last
one shown. Before that block, the median time past is too early.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Her transaction won’t even propagate through the Bitcoin network until
the lock time has passed. The nodes don’t want to keep time-locked
transactions in their memories because there are better uses for their
precious memory space than to fill them up with transactions that aren’t
even valid (yet). It’s up to your daughter to broadcast the transaction
after the lock time has passed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_block_height">Block height</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also express time using block height. You can say that a
transaction isn’t valid, for example, until after block height 571019.
This means the transaction shown in <a href="#fig0904">Figure 4</a> can’t be mined until
after block 571019 has been mined.</p>
</div>
<div id="fig0904" class="imageblock">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 4. A time-locked transaction based on block height. This transaction is first valid at block height 571020.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The earliest block in which the transaction can be included is at
height 571020. It’s hard to predict exactly when that block will be
mined, but thanks to the difficulty adjustments that keep the average
block time at about 10 minutes, you can expect about 52,596 blocks per
year.</p>

<h4 id="_relative_time_locks">9.1.2. Relative time locks</h4>
<div class="sidebarblock inbitcoin">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">BIP68</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) describes how an input can
require a certain distance in time or blocks from the spent
transaction output.  It applies to transactions with a version of at
least 2.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The earlier example showed a use case for absolute time locks on
transactions. But you can also lock an input of a transaction until its
spent output is old enough. This is called a <em>relative time lock</em>. You
do this on a per-input basis (<a href="#fig0905">Figure 5</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="fig0905" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch09/09-05.svg" alt="09 05" width="100%">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 5. Relative time locks can be expressed either as a number of blocks or as a number of time units. You use the inputs’ sequence numbers for this.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transaction’s first input has a sequence number of <code>004013c6</code>. This
says the transaction isn’t valid until 30 days have passed since the
spent output was confirmed (<a href="#fig0906">Figure 6</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="fig0906" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch09/09-06.svg" alt="09 06" width="100%">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 6. The first input locks the transaction for 30 days from the spent output.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The leftmost bit of this sequence number is 0, which means the relative
lock time is enabled. The bit at index 9 from the left is 1, which means
the rightmost 16 bits should be interpreted as “number of 512-second
intervals.” The 16 rightmost bits are <code>13c6</code>, which translates to 5,062
in decimal form; 5,062 intervals of 512 seconds is roughly 30 days.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second input has a sequence number of <code>000003e8</code> (<a href="#fig0907">Figure 7</a>). This
means the transaction is invalid until 1,000 blocks have been mined
since the spent output was mined.</p>
</div>
<div id="fig0907" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch09/09-07.svg" alt="09 07" width="100%">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 7. The second input locks the transaction for 1,000 blocks from the spent output.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The leftmost bit is 0 here, too, which means the relative lock time is
enabled for this input. The bit at index 9 from the left is 0, which
means the 16 rightmost bits should be interpreted as the number of
blocks; <code>03e8</code> is hex code for 1,000.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transaction’s version needs to be at least 2 for relative time
locks to work. If the version is 1, the sequence numbers won’t have
any effect on the relative lock time, but they will affect absolute
lock time and the replace-by-fee feature, which I’ll discuss later in
<a href="#replace-by-fee">Section 9.4</a>.</p>

<h3 id="_time_locked_outputs">9.2. Time-locked outputs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Time locks aren’t particularly useful in themselves. The only thing you
can do with them is create a transaction that might eventually become
valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It might be more useful to say something like, “The money in this output
can’t be spent before New Year’s Eve.” This is an example of a
<em>time-locked output</em>. An output can be locked absolutely or
relatively, and locks can be time-based or height-based.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third transaction is OK because the time lock is at least as high as
the time in the pubkey script, 2019-05-01 00:00:00. This transaction
will be valid on and after 1 May. The last transaction will be valid on
New Year’s Eve, right before the fireworks. Note, however, that you
can’t get both of the last two transactions confirmed—you can get at
most one of them confirmed—because they spend the same output.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A relative time-locked output works similarly to an absolute

<p>Relative time locks are most commonly used in <em>digital contracts</em>. A
digital contract can be regarded as a traditional contract between
parties, but it’s enforced by the rules of the Bitcoin network rather
than national laws. Contracts are expressed as Bitcoin pubkey scripts.
We’ll illustrate the use of relative time-locked outputs with an atomic
swap in the next subsection. An atomic swap means two people swap coins
with each other across different cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The output of John’s contract transaction can be spent in one of two
ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>By providing the pre-image of H and Fadime’s signature. John knows this
pre-image—his secret number S from the conversation described
earlier—but Fadime doesn’t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With John’s signature after 48 hours.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Likewise, the output of Fadime’s contract transaction can be spent in

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>By providing the pre-image of H and John’s signature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With Fadime’s signature after 24 hours</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The relative lock time is enforced by the script operator
<code>OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY</code>. This operator ensures that the output of
John’s contract transaction can’t be spent by John until 48 hours have
passed since the contract transaction was confirmed. In Fadime’s
contract transaction, the operator ensures that Fadime doesn’t spend
the output until after 24 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fadime knows John has the secret number. If Fadime broadcasts her
contract transaction now, John can take the money and not fulfill his
part of the deal. For this reason, she won’t broadcast her transaction
until she’s seen John’s transaction safely confirmed in the
blockchain.  Because Fadime doesn’t know the secret, S, John can
safely broadcast his contract transaction without Fadime running away
with the money.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>John broadcasts his contract transaction. Remember that the output of
the contract transaction in this example is a pay-to-script-hash
(p2sh) output. The output contains a p2sh address that doesn’t say
anything about this being John’s contract output. For Fadime to
identify John’s contract transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, she’ll
construct the same redeem script as John created for his contract
transaction and generate the p2sh address that John’s contract
transaction paid to. She can then look for that p2sh address in the
Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Fadime finds that John’s transaction is confirmed, she broadcasts
her own contract transaction. John waits until Fadime’s transaction is
sufficiently confirmed on the Namecoin blockchain. Then, the actual
swap happens in two steps. <a href="#fig0912">Figure 12</a> shows the first step.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 12. The first step of the actual swap. John claims Fadime’s 100 NMC by revealing the secret S.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>John broadcasts his swap transaction. John’s swap transaction spends
Fadime’s contract transaction output by providing S and his signature.
Again, note that John is spending a p2sh output. This means the first
thing that happens during script validation is that the redeem script
John provided in the signature script will be hashed and compared to the
hash in the pubkey script. The actual redeem script will then be run.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We won’t go through the program in detail. But when the redeem script
starts running, the stack will have <code>1</code> on top. This means <code>true</code> in
Namecoin, just as in Bitcoin. This value will cause the program to run
the part of the script that requires a pre-image and John’s signature.
The other part isn’t run at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The script will leave the stack with a <code>true</code> on top because John
provides both required items in the correct order—his signature and the
pre-image, <code>S</code>. He successfully claims his 100 NMC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As soon as Fadime sees John’s swap transaction on the Namecoin network,
she can create her own swap transaction for the Bitcoin blockchain
(<a href="#fig0913">Figure 13</a>).</p>

<div class="title">Figure 13. Fadime completes the atomic swap by sending her swap transaction to the Bitcoin network.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She takes the pre-image, S, from John’s swap transaction and puts it
into her own swap transaction, which pays 2 BTC to Fadime’s public key
hash, PKH<sub>F</sub>. When the two swap transactions are confirmed, the atomic
swap is complete. The effect of all this is that John has sent 2 BTC to
Fadime under the condition that Fadime sends 100 NMC to him, and Fadime
sends 100 NMC to John under the condition that John sends<br>
2 BTC to her.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_atomic_swap_failure">Atomic swap failure</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sequence of events in this atomic swap example illustrates a case in
which both parties, John and Fadime, play by the rules. No one had to
actually use the time-locked branches of the contract transaction
outputs. This subsection will go through some ways the swap might fail:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Fadime doesn’t broadcast her contract transaction.</dt>
<dd>
<p>This means John
can’t spend the output of Fadime’s contract transaction, which means
Fadime will never get to see S. Without S, she can’t spend John’s
contract output. The only possible outcome is that John must wait 48
hours for the relative time lock to pass and then reclaim his money.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">John doesn’t spend Fadime’s contract output in 24 hours.</dt>
<dd>
<p>Fadime can
reclaim her coins, and John must wait another 24 hours before claiming
his coins back.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">John spends Fadime’s contract output just after 24 hours has passed but before Fadime claims back her coins.</dt>
<dd>
<p>Fortunately, John’s
contract output has a 48-hour relative lock time as opposed to the 24
hours in Fadime’s contract output, so John can’t claim his coins back
until he’s waited another 24 hours. During this time, Fadime can claim
her BTC from John’s contract output using S and her signature.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Fadime gets hit by a bus just after broadcasting her contract output.</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is no good. John will be able to take his NMC from Fadime’s
contract output and then wait 48 hours to also claim back his BTC.
Fadime loses out on this one.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the final case, we could argue that the swap wasn’t atomic. After
all, it didn’t go through, and John ended up with all the coins. This
is a somewhat philosophical question. But we can think of swaps as
being atomic under the condition that Fadime can take action. We don’t
have this condition for John, though. It’s a matter of who creates the
secret, S.</p>

<p>Because these PKHs are made up, they have no known pre-images. This also
means no known public/private key pairs are associated with them, so no
one can ever spend the outputs. They’re <em>unspendable</em>. The last PKH’s
Bitcoin address is <code>157sXYpj…QnHB6FGU</code>. Anyone who pays money to this
address is throwing that money in the trash. The money is lost forever.
It’s the equivalent of burning a dollar bill.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unspendable outputs like these are indistinguishable from ordinary,
spendable outputs. You can’t prove that they’re unspendable. Full nodes
have to treat them as spendable, meaning they have to keep these
unspendable outputs in their unspent transaction output (UTXO) set
forever. This places an unnecessary burden on nodes, which need to keep
all these outputs in memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bitcoin’s developers came up with a partial solution to this problem.
Instead of sending money to unprovably unspendable outputs, users can
create <em>provably unspendable</em> outputs. If a full node can determine if
an output is unspendable,<br>
it doesn’t have to insert that output into its UTXO set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The partial solution involves a new script operator called <code>OP_RETURN</code>.
This operator immediately fails when executed. A typical <code>OP_RETURN</code>
pubkey script can look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>OP_RETURN "I'm Grokking Bitcoin"</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If someone tried to spend this output, the script would fail once it
encountered the <code>OP_RETURN</code>. If the pubkey script contains this
operator, a full node can determine that the output isn’t spendable and
ignore it, saving the UTXO set from being forever bloated with this
nonsense. A typical <code>OP_RETURN</code> output pays 0 BTC, but it can also set a
value greater than 0 to “burn” money.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a few policies regarding <code>OP_RETURN</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The full pubkey script must not be bigger than 83 bytes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There can be only one <code>OP_RETURN</code> output per transaction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These two policies are just that—policies. Full nodes adhering to
these policies won’t relay transactions that violate them. But if they
encounter a block that contains transactions that violate the
policies, the block will be accepted and relayed. I’ll talk more about
policies and <em>consensus rules</em>, strict rules that apply to blocks,

isn’t confirmed, you won’t get your book. You probably want to do
something about this situation. Maybe you can create a new, similar
transaction, but with a higher fee. Let’s try (<a href="#fig0919">Figure 19</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That’s nice: you’ve created and signed a new transaction with a fee 20
times higher. This will surely get mined, you think, and broadcast the
transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem is that your new transaction will probably be regarded as a
double-spend attempt and be dropped by most nodes. They’ll think the
first transaction is the one that counts, and they’ll disregard any
further transactions that spend the same output. How to handle the
second transaction is completely up to the nodes, but the most common
policy is to drop it. This is what Bitcoin Core does, and that’s the
most widely used Bitcoin software. This policy is known as the
<em>first-seen policy</em>.</p>

<p>Keep this in mind for <a href="#exercise-rbf">Exercise 11</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might be able to circumvent this policy by sending the second
transaction directly to one or more miners. Miners have different
incentives than full nodes. Mining full nodes want to earn
rewards—subsidy + fees—by providing proof of work to the blockchain,
whereas non-mining full nodes want to keep their memory and computing
resource consumption down. If a miner could get hold of the second,
high-fee transaction, it would probably decide to include it despite
the fact that the low-fee transaction was the first seen. Replacing
transactions in this way is impractical because you don’t know any
miners’ IP addresses unless they’re published somehow. You also reveal
your IP address to the miners, and the miners then become targets for
various surveillance organizations or companies wanting to monetize
information about you.</p>

<div class="sidebarblock inbitcoin">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">BIP125</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This BIP describes how transactions can declare themselves
replaceable.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2016, a policy was deployed for transaction replacement. It’s
generally called <em>opt-in replace-by-fee</em>, or opt-in RBF
(<a href="#fig0920">Figure 20</a>). It works by using the sequence numbers of a
transaction’s inputs.</p>
</div>
<div id="fig0920" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch09/09-20.svg" alt="09 20" width="75%">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 20. Use opt-in RBF to easily replace a transaction before it’s confirmed.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose again that you want to pay for a book in an online bookstore.
When you create the transaction, you make sure one of the inputs
(there’s only one in this example) has a sequence number less than
<code>fffffffe</code>. This signals to nodes that you want this transaction to be
replaceable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a node receives this transaction, it will be treated as a normal
transaction, but the replaceability will be remembered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you later notice that your transaction doesn’t confirm because of a
too-low fee, you can create a new, replacement transaction with a higher
fee. When you broadcast the replacement transaction, the nodes receiving
it will—if they implement the opt-in RBF policy—kindly replace the old
transaction with the new one and relay the new one to their peers. The
old transaction will be dropped. This way, the replacement transaction
will eventually reach all nodes, including miners, and will hopefully be
confirmed within a reasonable time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, you set the sequence number of the replacement
transaction’s input to <code>ffffffff</code>. This means the replacement
transaction is not itself replaceable. If you want the replacement
transaction to also be replaceable, you must set its sequence number to
<code>fffffffd</code> or less, just as you did with the replaced transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might be wondering where these sequence numbers come from. The
intention with sequence numbers from the beginning was to allow for
another kind of transaction replacement. The feature was disabled early
in Bitcoin, but the sequence numbers remained in the transaction inputs.
These sequence numbers have since been repurposed for absolute lock
time, relative lock time, and replace-by-fee, as described throughout
this chapter. If you feel confused, don’t worry; I’ll summarize the
different uses of sequence numbers in <a href="#ch09-recap">Section 9.6</a>.</p>

transaction spends money that doesn’t exist in the blockchain.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="sighash-types">9.5. Different signature types</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you sign a typical Bitcoin transaction, you sign the entire
transaction, excluding the signature script (<a href="#fig0923">Figure 23</a>).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This transaction contains two inputs, and each input signs the complete
transaction. A signature <em>commits to</em> all inputs and all outputs. If any
of the inputs or outputs change, the signature will become invalid.</p>
</div>

<p>You can change this signature behavior using a parameter in the
signature called the <code>SIGHASH</code> type. You can commit to outputs in three
ways (<code>ALL</code>, <code>SINGLE</code>, and <code>NONE</code>) and to inputs in two ways
(<code>ANYONECANPAY</code> set or not set). Any combination of an input <code>SIGHASH</code>
type and an output <code>SIGHASH</code> type can be used, which makes six different
combinations, as <a href="#fig0924">Figure 24</a> shows.</p>

<li>
<p><em>No outputs (<code>NONE</code>)</em>—You don’t care where the money goes. Anyone
can add any outputs without invalidating your signature.</p>
</li>

<p>For the inputs, you can commit as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

ways to prevent funds from being spent until a certain date or time span
has occurred, as the following table shows.</p>

<p>All these variants can be expressed in either block height or time. Time
locks are useful mostly in digital contracts, such as atomic swaps. An
atomic swap lets people who don’t trust each other swap coins without
using a trusted third party.</p>

<p>Arbitrary data can be stored in <code>OP_RETURN</code> outputs without placing a
burden on nodes’ UTXO sets. You can use this to create tokens. For
example, the ownership of a car can be tracked and verified on the
Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A transaction can sometimes get stuck in a pending state because no
miners want to include it in their blocks. This usually happens
because you’ve paid a too-small fee. To prepare for this situation,
you can mark the transaction as replaceable by setting the sequence
number of at least one input to a value lower than <code>fffffffe</code>. If that
transaction gets stuck, you can bump the the fee by broadcasting a
replacement transaction that pays a higher fee.</p>
