<p>A cryptographic hash function.</p>

<li>
<p><code>061a</code> is <code>6*256 + (16 + 10) = 1,536 + 26 = 1,562</code> in decimal
form. The binary form of <code>06</code> is <code>0000 0110</code>, and the binary form of
<code>1a</code> is <code>0001 1010</code>, so the full binary representation is <code>0000 0110
0001 1010</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No. If it was possible, the function wouldn’t be
second-pre-image-resistant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Properties 2 and 4 are lacking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second-pre-image resistance is stopping the attacker. The attacker
needs to find an input that gives the same hash as a certain other
input: the cat picture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The money supply increase rate will decrease over time because the
reward to Lisa halves every 4 years. This means the total amount of CT
to ever be created will be about 21,000,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coworkers have read access to the spreadsheet. They can watch
the spreadsheet and verify that Lisa doesn’t reward herself too much or
too often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The private key is created using a random number generator of
some sort. A simple one is a coin that you flip 256 times to generate
your 256-bit private key. You can also use your operating system’s
built-in random number generator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The private key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The message is hashed because you want signatures to be small and
fixed in size. You don’t want the signatures to be big just because the
signed message is big.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mallory would need John’s private key to steal cookies from him.
She would also need his name, John, to write into the email to Lisa, but
that’s easily available in the spreadsheet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fred can use your public key to encrypt the message and send the
encrypted message to you. You can then decrypt that message using your
private key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You sign the message using your private key and write the digital
signature onto the note in the bottle. Fred can then verify that the
signature is in fact made with your private key. He does this by using
your public key to decrypt the signature and comparing the decrypted
hash with the actual hash of the message. If they match, he can be sure
the message is from you.</p>

<p>The PKH is made short because a) it makes the spreadsheet smaller
in size and b) it makes cookie token addresses (and Bitcoin addresses)
shorter to write for a user.</p>
</li>

<p>Yes, you can. There’s a base58check decoding algorithm that does
this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s used by a payer to translate the recipient’s address into a
PKH. The payer needs to write the recipient’s PKH in the email to Lisa.</p>
</li>

<p>Let’s base58-encode 0047 step by step:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Remove leading 00 bytes. There is one, which leaves you with 47.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert to a decimal number: 47 in hex is 4 × 16 + 7 = 71 in decimal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide 71 by 58: 71 = 1 × 58 + 13. The quotient is 1, and the remainder
is 13.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Divide the quotient, 1, by 58: 1 = 0 × 58 + 1. The quotient is 0, and
the remainder is 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look up the remainders 13 and 1. Result: E and 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a 1 for the removed 00 byte in step 1, which results in E21.</p>

<p>He must make two separate payments. For example: payment 1 pays 2
CT from @<sub>1</sub> to the cafe, and payment 2 pays 8 CT from @<sub>2</sub> to the cafe.
Another way is to first pay 2 CT from @<sub>1</sub> to @<sub>2</sub> and then pay 10 CT
from @<sub>2</sub> to the cafe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes it is. Base58check-encode the PKHs to get the addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, because the spreadsheet contains PKHs. Because cryptographic
hash functions are one-way functions, you can’t go from PKH to public
key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They can look at the amounts. Many of the 10 CT payments are
probably cookie purchases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bad guy can’t steal cookie tokens because he needs the public
key to exploit the flaw in the public key derivation function. The
spreadsheet contains PKHs; the bad guy can’t get the public key from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bad guy needs the private key to sign fraudulent emails to
Lisa. Even though he can reverse RIPEMD160, he’d still need to pre-image
attack SHA256 and reverse the public key derivation function to get to a
working private key.</p>

<p>An xprv consists of a private key and a chain code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An xpub consists of a public key and a chain code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The xprv at path <code>m/2/1</code> and the wanted index <code>7</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No, you would need xprv <code>m/2/1</code> to derive xpub <code>M/2/1/7'</code>. You
first derive hardened xprv <code>m/2/1/7'</code> from <code>m/2/1</code> using hardened xprv
derivation and then calculate the xpub <code>M/2/1/7'</code> from <code>m/2/1/7'</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use the following procedure to get the master xprv:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Use master xpub <code>M</code> to derive xpub <code>M/4</code> and remember the left-half

</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>M/4</code> to derive the left-half hash L<sub>41</sub> at index 1.</p>
</li>

<p><code>m</code> together with the chain code of xpub <code>M</code> is the master xprv.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, you’d be able to steal all funds in any addresses because
you can calculate the master xprv.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The victim could have used hardening to generate <code>m/4'</code> instead.
This way, you wouldn’t be able to get the master xprv. If you stole
<code>m/4'/1</code> and the master xpub, you would only be able to steal funds on
the <code>m/4'/1</code> key. You wouldn’t be able to calculate the <code>M/4'</code> xpub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The employees can import the xpub for the counter sales account.
They will then be able to generate any public keys under that account
and thus generate as many addresses as they need without ever having to
know any private keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your (and Anita’s) wallet can generate 10 addresses ahead of time
and monitor the spreadsheet for those addresses. If Anita gets paid to
one of these addresses—probably the first of those 10—then your wallet
won’t reuse that address when you request a payment from a customer. You
would instead take the next unused address.</p>

<li>
<p>You would spend the 4 CT and the 7 CT outputs. The new outputs
would be 10 CT to the cafe and 1 CT in change to an address you control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They’re used in inputs to reference transactions from which to
spend outputs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because you can’t spend part of a transaction output. You either
spend the output or you don’t. If the spent output contains more value
than you’re paying, you need to give back change to yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the signature scripts in the inputs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the verifiers need to know what public key to verify the
signature with. You can’t verify the signature with a PKH, so you need
to explicitly reveal the public key in the signature script.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The signature scripts are cleaned so that verifiers don’t have to
know the order in which the inputs are signed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each output of a transaction contains a pubkey script. It contains
the second part of a script program. The first part will be provided
later, when the output is spent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Script program must end with OK on top of the stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A p2sh address always starts with a <code>3</code>. You can also recognize it
by base58check-decoding it and looking at the first byte. If that byte
is 05, it’s a p2sh address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ll create a transaction with one input and three outputs:</p>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>10,003 UTXOs. You remove two UTXOs by spending two outputs, and
you add five new UTXOs. The net effect on the UTXO set is thus +3 UTXOs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pubkey script can be, for example, <code>1</code>. The spending input
can have an empty signature script. The full Script program just puts a
<code>1</code> on the stack. A result stack with non-zero on top means OK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>OP_ADD 10 OP_EQUAL</code>. This will first add the two top items on
the stack and put the result back on top. Then, you’ll push the number
10 to the stack and compare the two top items. If they’re equal, OK will
be pushed to the stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes. Your full node verifies everything in the spreadsheet from
the very first transaction up to the transaction containing your money
from Faiza. It verifies (among other things) the following:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lisa created the expected number of coinbase transactions with the
correct amounts in them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each transaction in the spreadsheet, the value sum of outputs
doesn’t exceed the value sum of inputs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All signatures from Faiza’s payment back to all coinbase transactions
are OK.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are several UTXOs to the same PKH, then as soon as one
of them is spent, the security of the other UTXOs to the same PKH will
be degraded. This is because you remove a layer of security, the
cryptographic hash function. From this point, you rely solely on the
public key derivation function to be secure. You can avoid this problem
by using unique addresses for all your incoming payments. Then, all your
UTXOs will have different PKHs.</p>

your transactions will eventually be confirmed by some noncolluding

</li>
<li>
<p>The target will increase. If the 2,016 blocks take 15 days instead
of the goal of 14 days, then it’s too hard to find blocks, so you need
to decrease the difficulty, which means increasing the target.</p>

<li>
<p>50%. But if you plan to give up at some point, your chances will

</li>

<p>The small block will reach the other miners more quickly than the

a big block. The small block is probably also quicker to verify than the
big block. Miners will probably download and verify the small block
faster than the big block and continue their mining activity on top of
the small block, which gives the small block a higher probability of
becoming part of the strongest chain.</p>

rewards. When she breaks the rules by changing the target prematurely,
all full nodes except Selma’s will discard her blocks. Selma will
continue working on her own branch of the blockchain with her new rules,
while all the rest will work on the branch with the old rules. The
branches will be mutually incompatible. The hashrate of the old branch
will drop to 48%, but the system will tick on, and everyone will
continue their daily lives as normal. Selma, on the other hand, will
spend a lot of electricity and time on her new branch, and no one will
buy her block rewards. The value of her mined coins will probably be
close to zero because she’s not following the rules. Selma is a loser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fee-per-byte metric used by most miners will be very low. For
every byte of transaction data the miner puts in its block, it will lose
a little competitiveness because the block will get bigger and thus
slower to transport over the network and to verify. If the fee per byte
for the transaction isn’t high enough to compensate for the lost
competitiveness, the miner probably won’t include it.</p>

<p>The redeem script contains two branches of code. The first branch

that all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<div class="openblock">

<ul>
<li>
<p>You have waited until New Year’s Eve.</p>

<p>You or Ruth signs the transaction.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be precise, you and Ruth can spend using the first branch with the

</div>
</div>

<p>The rightmost digit in both these signature scripts will select what

<li>
<p>No. The redeem script isn’t known to the nodes until the output is
spent. And because you can’t spend an <code>OP_RETURN</code> redeem script, nodes
will never know about the redeem script. The node will thus never know
that this is an unspendable output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A full node that receives a transaction will keep it in memory
until it’s included in a block. If a second, conflicting transaction
arrives, the node will drop that second transaction and not relay it. It
will consider the first-seen transaction as the “real” one and the
second transaction as a double-spend attempt. Nodes (including miners)
aren’t required to follow this policy because it’s just a policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miners can always select whatever valid transactions they want to
include in their blocks. Thus all transactions are in a way replaceable.
A miner can offer replacement as a service—that is, upload a
double-spend transaction with a high fee via the miner’s website to have
it confirmed in the miner’s next winning block.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is, of course, simpler for normal users to replace a transaction that
has opted in to RBF. But using services like the aforementioned one is
simple enough for a motivated thief. The difference in security
therefore isn’t as big as you might think.</p>

<p>The signature scripts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transaction, T<sub>2</sub>, that spends an output of an unconfirmed
transaction, T<sub>1</sub>, can become invalid if T<sub>1</sub> is changed into T<sub>1M</sub>
while being broadcast, and T<sub>1M</sub> gets confirmed. This causes a lot of
problems for contracts.</p>

<li>
<p>The time to verify a legacy transaction increases four times when
the number of inputs doubles. This is because</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You need to verify twice the number of signatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each signature takes double the time to verify because the transaction
to hash has doubled in size.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>To verify that the transaction is included in a block, the
lightweight wallet needs to calculate the transaction’s txid. The wallet
needs the signatures to calculate the txid because they’re included in
the txid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new behavior of <code>OP_NOP5</code> must, if it succeeds, be exactly
like the old behavior of <code>OP_NOP5</code>. This means it should have no effect
on the stack if it succeeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a (p2wpkh) and c (p2wsh) are segwit addresses. d is a p2sh
address, but it might contain a nested p2wpkh or p2wsh payment in the
redeem script. We can’t say for sure. But the address is a p2sh address,
not a segwit address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The witness version is used to make future upgrades easier. The
rule is that unknown witness versions are accepted. When a new witness
version is deployed, old nodes will accept any payment that spends
outputs with that new witness version. This avoids causing old and new
nodes to follow different branches of the blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All data items in the signature script are pushed to the stack.
No such items exist in the signature script, so there’s nothing to do
there. Then, <code>00</code> will be pushed followed by <code>c805…cba8</code>. The Script
program is then finished, and the top item on the stack is checked. It’s
not zero, which means the spending is valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new node will notice that the output has the segwit pattern.
It will also notice that the witness version is <code>00</code> and that the
witness program is 20 bytes. That means this is a p2wpkh output. To
spend such an output, the signature script must be empty, and the
witness must contain exactly a signature and the pubkey corresponding to
the witness program, <code>PKH<sub>Y</sub></code>. The p2wpkh template is filled in using
the signature and public key from the witness field and the PKH from the
pubkey script (the witness program). The filled-in template is then run
normally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fee merkle root can be placed in the right branch under the
witness commitment. But you also need to put the fee merkle root in the
witness for the coinbase input so that old segwit nodes can verify the
witness root hash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An old segwit node will verify the block exactly as before. The
witness reserved value will be taken from the witness of the coinbase
input. Using the hash from the witness lets the old node build the
witness commitment and compare it with the hash in the <code>OP_RETURN</code>
output, but it won’t know that the witness reserved value is a fee
merkle root. Old nodes thus won’t be able to verify the fee merkle tree.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A new node will do the same verification as an old node, but it will
also calculate the fee merkle root and compare it to the hash in the
coinbase’s witness.</p>

<p>Yes. Suppose the 11 timestamps before B<sub>1</sub>, sorted by value, are</p>
<div class="openblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e ≤ MTP<sub>1</sub> ≤ g ≤ h ≤ i ≤ j ≤ k</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To calculate MTP<sub>2</sub> of block B<sub>2</sub> following B<sub>1</sub>, add T<sub>1</sub> to this list.
Because a timestamp of a block needs to be strictly later than the MTP
of the block, T<sub>1</sub> must be sorted to the right of MTP<sub>1</sub> in the list.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e ≤ MTP<sub>1</sub> ≤ g ≤ h ≤ T<sub>1</sub> ≤ i ≤ j ≤ k</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You must also remove the timestamp of the block with lowest height from
the list of timestamps. No matter what timestamp you remove, MTP<sub>2</sub> will
be either MTP<sub>1</sub> (if you remove a timestamp to the right of it), or the
timestamp immediately to the right of MTP<sub>1</sub> (if you remove a timestamp
to the left of it) which can be either g or T<sub>1</sub>:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If MTP<sub>2</sub> = MTP<sub>1</sub>, then MTP<sub>2</sub> &lt; timeout because MTP<sub>1</sub> &lt; timeout.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If MTP<sub>2</sub> = g, then MTP<sub>2</sub> ≤ T<sub>1</sub> &lt; timeout.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If MTP<sub>2</sub> = T<sub>1</sub> then MTP<sub>2</sub> &lt; timeout because T<sub>1</sub> &lt; timeout.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, the MTP of B<sub>2</sub> is less than timeout in all cases, and all blocks
(&gt;95%) of the last 2,016 blocks signal support, which means the
deployment will move to <code>LOCKED_IN</code> and—2,016 blocks later—to <code>ACTIVE</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>A portion (&lt;30%) of the economy starts rejecting blocks that
don’t comply with your soft fork. This means you’ll cause a blockchain
split that will remain as long as a majority of miners support the Old
branch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When most of the economy starts rejecting Old blocks, miners
probably won’t want to mine Old blocks because the block rewards will
become nearly worthless for them. It would be hard for miners to sell
their Old coins on an exchange or pay for electricity with them. If they
switch to mine New blocks instead, plenty of options exist for
exchanging their block rewards for goods, services, or other currencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nonmining users using Old software will automatically switch
to the New branch once that branch is stronger than the Old branch. This
is because, in a soft fork, the New branch is valid according to the Old
software.</p>
