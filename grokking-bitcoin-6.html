<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#ch05">[ch05]</a>, we discussed transactions that let anyone verify all
transactions in the spreadsheet. But there are still things verifiers
can’t verify—that Lisa doesn’t remove or censor transactions. We’ll
handle censorship resistance in chapters 7 and 8. This chapter examines
how to make it impossible for Lisa to remove or replace transactions
without also making it obvious that she’s tampered with the transaction
history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lisa does this by replacing the spreadsheet with a <em>blockchain</em>
(<a href="#fig0601">Figure 1</a>). The blockchain contains transactions that are secured
from tampering through hashing and signing the set of transactions in
a clever way. This technique makes it easy to provide cryptographic
proof of fraud if Lisa deletes or replaces transactions. All verifiers
keep their own copies of the blockchain, and they can fully verify it
to ensure that Lisa doesn’t remove already-confirmed transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter also introduces a lightweight wallet, or <em>simplified
payment verification</em> (SPV) wallet, that will defer blockchain
verification to someone else—a full node—to save bandwidth and storage
space. This is possible thanks to the blockchain, but it comes at a
cost.</p>

<h3 id="_lisa_can_delete_transactions">6.1. Lisa can delete transactions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted several times before, Lisa can delete transactions. For
example, Lisa could buy a cookie from the cafe, eat it, and delete the
transaction. Of course, she wouldn’t do this because she’s the most
trustworthy person on earth, but not all her coworkers know or believe
this. Suppose she does indeed delete a transaction, as <a href="#fig0602">Figure 2</a> shows.</p>
</div>
<div id="fig0602" class="imageblock">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 2. Lisa buys a cookie and then reverts the transaction. She just stole a cookie from the cafe! The cafe and Lisa now have different UTXO sets.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later, when the cafe notices that the transaction has disappeared, it
can’t prove that Lisa’s transaction was ever in the spreadsheet. And
Lisa can’t prove it wasn’t there. This situation is troublesome. If it’s
word against word, you’re in for a long and costly dispute, possibly
involving lawyers, police, Acme Insurances, and private detectives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How can you prove whether a transaction was confirmed? Lisa needs a way
to publish transactions and their ordering such that she can’t tamper
with them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_building_the_blockchain">6.2. Building the blockchain</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lisa can delete transactions because no one can prove that the list of
all transactions has changed. What if we could change the system to make
it provable that she’s fiddled with history?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among your coworkers, some developers suggest getting rid of the cookie
token spreadsheet and replacing it with a blockchain (<a href="#fig0603">Figure 3</a>).</p>

<div class="title">Blockchain length</div>
<div class="paragraph movingtarget">
<p>The Bitcoin blockchain contains hundreds of thousands of blocks. At the
time of writing, the chain tip had height 550,836.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the blockchain, each block references the previous block and has an
implicit <em>height</em> that says how far it is from the first block. The
first block has height 0, the second block has height 1, and so on. In
<a href="#fig0603">Figure 3</a>, the <em>chain tip</em>, or last block, of this blockchain is
at height 7, meaning the blockchain is 8 blocks long. Every 10
minutes, Lisa puts recent unconfirmed transactions into a new block
and makes it available to everybody who’s interested.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The blockchain stores transactions just like the spreadsheet did. But
each block also contains a <em>block header</em> to protect the integrity of
the contained transactions and the blockchain before it. Let’s say the
blockchain in <a href="#fig0603">Figure 3</a> has grown to contain 20 blocks, so the chain
tip is at height 19. <a href="#fig0604">Figure 4</a> zooms in on the last few blocks of the
blockchain.</p>

<p>The hash of a block header is an identifier for the block, just as a
transaction hash, or transaction ID (txid), is an identifier for a
transaction. I’ll sometimes refer to the block header hash as the
<em>block ID</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The leftmost part of the block header is the block ID of the previous
block in the blockchain. This is why it’s called a block_chain_. The
previous block-header hashes form a chain of block headers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second part from the left is the combined hash of the
transactions.  This is the <em>merkle root</em> of a <em>merkle tree</em>. We’ll
talk about this in later sections of this chapter, but for now, let’s
just say that the transactions in the block are hashed together into a
single hash value that’s written into the block header. You can’t
change any transactions in the block without also changing the merkle
root.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third part from the left is the block’s creation time. This time
isn’t exact and doesn’t even always increase from block to block. But
it’s roughly accurate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fourth part is Lisa’s block signature, which is a stamp of
approval from Lisa that anyone can verify. Lisa’s signature proves
that she once approved the block, which can be held against her if she
tries to cheat.  You’ll see how this works shortly. The digital
signature in the block header introduces some problems, which we’ll
fix in <a href="#ch07">[ch07]</a> by replacing these digital signatures with something
called <em>proof of work</em>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bitcoin doesn’t use a shared folder. The shared folder is a

<a href="#ch08">[ch08]</a>.</p>

<p>Lisa creates a new block roughly every 10 minutes, containing
unconfirmed transactions. She writes this block into a new file in a
shared folder. Everyone has permission to create new files in the
shared folder, but no one has permission to delete or change
files. When Lisa writes a block to a file in the shared folder, she
<em>confirms</em> the transactions in that block.</p>

<p>Suppose Lisa is about to create a new block at height 20. She’ll do the

<p>She collects several transactions to put in the block. She then creates

<p>In Bitcoin, the block reward covers more than just the newly created

newly created money in a block is called the <em>block subsidy</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first transaction in her block is a coinbase transaction. Blocks’
coinbase transactions create 50 CT per block instead of 7,200 CT as
was the case in <a href="#ch05">[ch05]</a>. The idea is that Lisa produces a new block
every 10 minutes, which means her daily 7,200 CT reward is spread out
over 144 blocks: there are 144 blocks in 24 hours, and 144*50 CT =
7,200 CT.  We’ll talk more about block rewards and the coinbase in
<a href="#ch07">[ch07]</a>.</p>

<p>The public key corresponding to Lisa’s block-signing key must be made
publicly available to all verifiers. The company can publish the public
key on its intranet and on a bulletin board at the main entrance. The
signature is required because only Lisa should be able to add blocks to
the blockchain (for now). For example, John, can create a block and
write it to the shared folder. But he won’t be able to sign it correctly
because he doesn’t have Lisa’s private key, so no one will accept John’s
block.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using private keys to sign blocks can be a bad idea for two reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lisa’s private key can be stolen. If this happens, the thief can create
valid blocks and write them to the shared folder. These blocks’ coinbase
transactions will of course pay the block rewards to the thief’s PKH,
and not to Lisa’s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sources containing Lisa’s public key—for example, the bulletin board
and the intranet—might be compromised and the public keys replaced by
some bad guy’s public key. If this happens, some verifiers will be
tricked into accepting blocks signed by a key other than Lisa’s
block-signing key. The bad guy can fool some portion of the verifiers. A
coworker shouldn’t trust just the note on the bulletin board, because
it’s easy for someone to replace the note with a false public key.
Coworkers need to get the public key from different sources, such as the
bulletin board, the intranet, and by asking fellow workers. A single
source is too easily manipulated by bad guys.</p>

signature is no longer valid, and the header needs to be re-signed. To
make the changed block available to verifiers, she needs to put the

prove Lisa is playing dirty tricks because she’s created two different

you no longer have a word-against-word situation. Lisa will be fired

<h4 id="_why_use_a_blockchain">6.2.3. Why use a blockchain?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The blockchain is a complicated way to sign a bunch of transactions.
Wouldn’t it be much simpler if Lisa just signed all transactions ever
made in one big chunk every 10 minutes? This would accomplish the same
goal. But this approach has several problems:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>As the number of transactions grows, the time it takes for Lisa to
sign the entire set will increase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same goes for verifiers—the time it takes to verify a signature
increases with the total number of transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s hard for verifiers to know what’s new since the last signature.
This information is valuable when maintaining the UTXO set.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By using the blockchain, Lisa has to sign only the most recent block of
transactions while still, indirectly via the previous block ID pointer,
signing all historic transactions, as <a href="#fig0614">Figure 14</a> shows.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coworkers who want to verify the blockchain to make sure they have
valid financial information use software that downloads the entire
blockchain and keeps a UTXO set up to date at all times. This software
needs to run nearly all the time to stay up to date with newly
produced blocks. We call this running software a <em>full node</em>. A full
node knows about all transactions since block 0, the <em>genesis
block</em>. The company and the cafe are typical full-node users. They
don’t have to trust someone else with providing them with financial
information: they get their information directly from the
blockchain. Anyone is free to run this software as they please.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#ch04">[ch04]</a>, I introduced a mobile app that coworkers can use to
manage their private keys, as well as send and receive money. This
wallet app has now been adapted to the new blockchain system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because most wallet users are on a mobile data plan, they don’t want
to waste bandwidth on downloading all—for them, uninteresting—block
data.  The overwhelming majority of the blocks won’t contain any
transactions concerning them, so downloading all that data would only
make their phones run out of data traffic without providing useful
information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The full-node developers and the wallet developers cooperate to let
wallets connect to full nodes over the internet and get relevant block
data from those nodes in a way that doesn’t require huge amounts of
data traffic. Wallets are allowed to connect to any full node and ask
for the data they need.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose John’s wallet contains two addresses, @<sub>a</sub> and @<sub>b</sub>, and he
wants to receive notifications from a full node about transactions
concerning his wallet. He can make a network connection to any of the
full nodes—for example, the cafe’s. The wallet and the full node then
start talking, as <a href="#fig0615">Figure 15</a> shows.</p>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>John’s wallet asks the full node for all block headers since the
wallet’s last known block header and all transactions concerning John’s
addresses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cafe’s full node sends all requested block headers to the wallet
and at least all transactions concerning John’s addresses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In step 1, the wallet doesn’t send the exact list of addresses in John’s
wallet. This would harm John’s privacy because the cafe would then know
that all John’s addresses belong together and could sell that
information to Acme Insurances. Not nice. John’s wallet instead sends a
filter to the full node. This filter is called a <em>bloom filter</em>. The
full node uses it to determine whether to send a transaction to the
wallet. The filter tells the full node to send all transactions
concerning @<sub>a</sub> and @<sub>b</sub>, but it also tells the full node to send
transactions that aren’t relevant to John’s wallet, to obfuscate what
addresses actually belong to the wallet. Although bloom filters don’t
have much to do with the blockchain, I still dedicate a subsection to
them here because lightweight wallets use them extensively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In step 2, transactions and block headers are sent to John’s wallet, but
the complete blocks aren’t sent (to save network traffic). John’s wallet
can’t use just a transaction and the header to verify that the
transaction is in the block. Something more is required: a <em>partial
merkle tree</em> that proves that one or more transactions are included in
the block.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two steps are performed as a synchronizing phase just after the
wallet connects to the cafe’s full node. After this, as Lisa creates
new blocks and the cafe’s full node picks them up, the corresponding
block headers are sent to the wallet together with all transactions
concerning John’s addresses in roughly the same way as described
earlier.</p>

is then set to <code>1</code>. Then PKH<sub>a</sub> is run through the second hash
function, which outputs <code>0</code>, and the corresponding bit (the first
from the left in the figure) is set to <code>1</code>. Finally, the third hash
function outputs <code>6</code>, and the bit at index 6 (seventh from the left)
is set to <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>Next up is PKH<sub>b</sub>, which is handled the exact same way. The three hash

<h5 id="_use_the_bloom_filter">Use the bloom filter</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The full node receives the bloom filter from the wallet and wants to
use it to filter transactions to send to the wallet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose Lisa just published a new block to the shared folder, and the
full node has verified the block. The full node now wants to send the
new block’s header and all relevant transactions in it to the wallet.
How does the full node use the bloom filter to determine what
transactions to send?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The block contains three transactions: Tx<sub>1</sub>, Tx<sub>2</sub>, and Tx<sub>3</sub> (<a href="#fig0618">Figure 18</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tx<sub>1</sub> and Tx<sub>3</sub> have nothing to do with John’s addresses, but Tx<sub>2</sub> is a
payment to John’s address @<sub>b</sub>. Let’s look at how the full node uses the
bloom filter (<a href="#fig0619">Figure 19</a>).</p>
</div>
<div id="fig0619" class="imageblock">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 19. The full node uses the bloom filter to determine which transactions are “interesting” to the wallet.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For each output in a transaction, the node tests whether any PKH
matches the filter. It starts with Tx<sub>1</sub>, which has a single output to
PKH<sub>L</sub>.  To test whether PKH<sub>L</sub> matches the filter, it runs PKH<sub>L</sub>
through the same three hash functions as John’s wallet did when the
filter was created. The hash functions output the indexes <code>5</code>, <code>1</code>,
and <code>0</code>. The bits at index <code>5</code> and <code>0</code> are both <code>1</code>, but the bit at
index <code>1</code> is <code>0</code>.  A 0 bit means PKH<sub>L</sub> definitely isn’t interesting
to John’s wallet. If John’s wallet was interested in PKH<sub>L</sub>, the
wallet would have added it to the filter, thus setting bit <code>1</code> to
<code>1</code>. Because PKH<sub>L</sub> was the only PKH in Tx<sub>1</sub>, John’s wallet isn’t
interested in this transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next transaction is Tx<sub>2</sub>. It contains two PKHs: PKH<sub>b</sub> and
PKH<sub>X</sub>.  It begins with PKH<sub>b</sub>. Running this PKH through the hash
functions gives the indexes <code>5</code>, <code>0</code>, and <code>3</code>. All three bits have the
value <code>1</code>. This means the node can’t say for sure if the transaction
is interesting to the wallet, but it can’t say that it’s definitely
<em>not</em> interesting.  Testing any further PKHs in this transaction is
pointless because the node has already determined that Tx<sub>2</sub> should be
sent to the wallet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last transaction has two outputs to PKH<sub>Y</sub> and PKH<sub>Z</sub>. It starts
with PKH<sub>Y</sub>, which happens to point at <code>2</code>, <code>7</code>, and <code>4</code>. Both bits <code>4</code>
and <code>7</code> are <code>0</code>, which means PKH<sub>Y</sub> definitely isn’t interesting to the
wallet. Let’s continue with PKH<sub>Z</sub>, which results in bits <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and
<code>0</code>. All three bits have the value <code>1</code>. This, again, means Tx<sub>3</sub> <em>might</em>
be interesting to the wallet, so the node will send this transaction,
too. John’s wallet doesn’t actually contain PKH<sub>Z</sub>, but the bloom
filter aims to match more than needed to preserve some degree of
privacy. We call this a <em>false positive</em> match.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The result of the bloom filtering is that the node will send Tx<sub>2</sub> and
Tx<sub>3</sub> to the wallet. How the transactions are sent is a totally
different story, described in <a href="#merkle-trees">Section 6.5</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The previous description is a simplification of what really
happens. You tested only PKHs of the transaction outputs described,
which would capture all transactions that pay cookie tokens <em>to</em> any
of John’s addresses. But what about transactions that are spending
<em>from</em> John’s addresses? We could argue that the full node doesn’t
need to send those transactions to the wallet because the wallet
already knows about them, given that it created them in the first
place. Unfortunately, you do need to send those transactions, for two
reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, it might not be this wallet app that created the transaction.
John can have multiple wallet apps that generate addresses from the
same seed. For example, do you remember in <a href="#ch04">[ch04]</a> how a wallet can
be restored from a mnemonic sentence? This sentence can be used by
multiple wallet apps at the same time. John might want to make a
payment from one of the wallet apps and be notified of the payment in
the other wallet app so he can monitor the total balance in that app.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, John wants to be notified when the transaction is
confirmed. The wallet app might already have the transaction, but it’s
still marked as <em>unconfirmed</em> in the app. John wants to know when the
transaction has been included in a block, so he needs the node to send
him this transaction when it’s in a block.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What the node really tests are the following items (<a href="#fig0620">Figure 20</a>):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The txid of the transaction</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The purpose of the bloom filter is to enhance user privacy. The level of
privacy can be controlled by tuning the ratio between the number of 1s
in the bloom filter and the bloom filter’s size. The more 1s in the
bloom filter in relation to the bloom filter’s size, the more false
positives. More false positives means the full node will send more
unrelated transactions to the wallet. More unrelated transactions means
more wasted data traffic but also improved privacy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s do some back-of-the-envelope calculations. The bloom filter in the
earlier example has 8 bits, of which five are 1s. A single hash
function’s output has a 5/8 probability of hitting a 1. For a single
test, the probability that all three hash functions hit a 1 is then
(5/8)<sup>3</sup>. The probability that a single test is negative—at least one of
the three hash functions points to a 0—is then 1 – (5/8)<sup>3</sup>. The full
node will perform several tests on each transaction, typically nine for
a transaction with two inputs and two outputs. Let’s check this against
the list of tests the full node performs:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The txid of the transaction (1)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All TXO references in the inputs (2)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All data items in signature scripts (public key and signature × 2 =
4)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All data items of the outputs (2)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The probability that all nine tests are negative is (1 – (5/8)<sup>3</sup>)<sup>9</sup> ≈
0.08. So, almost all—92/100—transactions will be sent to the wallet.
This shows that having only three 0s of 8 bits in the bloom filter won’t
help reduce the data much, but it protects your privacy better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get fewer false positives, John’s wallet must use a larger bloom
filter so the ratio (number of ones/bloom filter size) decreases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s define some symbols:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>t = Number of tests performed on a transaction (9)
p = Probability of a transaction being deemed uninteresting
r = Ratio of the number of 1s/bloom filter size</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can generalize our calculation as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\[(1-r^3)^t=p \Rightarrow 1-r^3=p^{\frac{1}{t}} \Rightarrow r^3=1-p^{\frac{1}{t}} \\
\Rightarrow r=\sqrt[3]{1-p^{\frac{1}{t}}}\]
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s say you only want to get 1/10 of all transactions (given that all
transactions are like the previous transaction, with two inputs and two
outputs). How big do you have to make the bloom filter?</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\[t = 9, p = \frac{9}{10} \\
r = \sqrt[3]{1-p^{\frac{1}{t}}}
  = \sqrt[3]{1-(\frac{9}{10})^{\frac{1}{9}}} ≈ 0.23\]
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This calculation means the bloom filter should be about 6/0.23 ≈ 26 bits
to get only 1/10 of all transactions. The bloom filter size must be a
multiple of 8 bits, so 26 bits isn’t allowed. We can round upward to 32
bits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that these are rough calculations based on somewhat false
assumptions regarding transaction characteristics. We also aren’t
considering that the number of 1s in the example isn’t strictly six but
can be anywhere from three to six, given that both John’s addresses
could have generated the same set of indexes. But this process should
help you get an idea of how big a bloom filter must be.</p>

<p>A node that receives bloom filters from a lightweight client

<p>When a full node first receives a bloom filter from a

matching transactions. This scanning is processing and disk intensive
and can take several minutes, depending on the full node’s hardware.
This fact can be used maliciously to attack full nodes so they become

<p>New Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), BIP157 and BIP158, have been

so a full node sends a filter to the lightweight wallet for each
block.  This filter contains information about what addresses the
block affects.  The lightweight client checks whether its addresses
match the filter and, if so, downloads the entire block. The block can
be downloaded from any source, not just the full node that sent the

enough.</p>

<h4 id="_creating_the_merkle_root">6.5.1. Creating the merkle root</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s time to reveal how Lisa created the merkle root. Suppose Lisa is
about to create the block header shown in <a href="#fig0622">Figure 22</a>. She needs to
calculate the combined hash of all transactions, called the merkle root
(<a href="#fig0623">Figure 23</a>). You calculate the merkle root by creating a hierarchy of
cryptographic hashes, a merkle tree.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 23. Lisa creates a merkle root from the transactions in a block.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transactions are ordered the same way they are in the block. If
the number of items is odd, the last item is duplicated and added
last. This extra item isn’t added to the block; it’s only duplicated
temporarily for the merkle tree calculation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each item (transaction, in this case) is hashed with double
SHA256. This results in four hash values of 256 bits each.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The hash values are pairwise <em>concatenated</em>, meaning two hashes are
merged by appending the second hash after the first hash. For example,
<code>abc</code> concatenated with <code>def</code> becomes <code>abcdef</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The four hash values have now become two concatenated values. Because
two is an even number, you don’t add an extra item at the end. The two
concatenated values are each hashed separately, resulting in two
256-bit hashes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These two hash values are concatenated into a single 512-bit
value. This value is hashed, resulting in the 256-bit merkle
root. This merkle root is written into the block header. If any
transaction is added, deleted, or changed, the merkle root must be
recalculated (<a href="#fig0624">Figure 24</a>).</p>

it thinks those transactions might be interesting to John’s
wallet. The full node wants to prove to the wallet that both Tx<sub>2</sub> and
Tx<sub>3</sub> are included in the block. But let’s begin with proving only a
single transaction, Tx<sub>2</sub>. We’ll look at a bigger, more complex
example later in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How can the full node provide proof to the wallet that Tx<sub>2</sub> is
included in the block? It can provide a <em>partial merkle tree</em> that
connects Tx<sub>2</sub> to the merkle root in the block header. The general
idea is to send the bare minimum to the lightweight wallet—just enough
to verify that Tx<sub>2</sub> is in the block. In this example, the node will
send the stuff in <a href="#fig0625">Figure 25</a> to the lightweight wallet.</p>

Tx<sub>2</sub> is in the block by calculating the intermediary hashes toward the

<p>Lightweight wallets seem like a nice touch for the cookie token system.
They certainly are, but users should be aware of what they’re missing
out on compared to full nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Full nodes verify the blockchain’s complete history and know for sure
that the money a transaction spends exists and that the signatures are
valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lightweight wallet knows the entire chain of block headers. It will
verify that Lisa has correctly signed each block header. When the wallet
receives a transaction and a merkle proof, it can check that the
transaction is contained in the block and that Lisa signed that block.
But it can’t verify a lot of other things. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>That the script programs in the transaction all return “OK,” which
usually means verifying the signatures of all inputs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the spent outputs aren’t already spent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That it receives all relevant transactions</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lightweight wallet also doesn’t know what rules the full node is
following. The full node might have adopted a rule that pays double
the reward to Lisa. A typical full node would consider any block that
pays too much to Lisa as invalid because that isn’t a rule it signed
up for, and would drop the block.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lightweight wallet needs to trust the full node to verify those
things on its behalf and that the full node is following the rules the
wallet expects it to follow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The full node can hide relevant transactions to the wallet. This means
the wallet won’t be notified about some incoming or outgoing
transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lightweight wallet gives verification responsibility to the full
node it’s connected to. Suppose Lisa produces an invalid block—for
example, a block that contains a transaction that spends an output
that doesn’t exist. When the full node receives this block, it should
verify the block and drop it because it’s invalid. But there might be
occasions when the full node, deliberately or accidentally, doesn’t
detect the error. Perhaps the cafe is in cahoots with Lisa to fool
John—who knows?  The cafe and Lisa can, at least temporarily, make
John believe he’s received money that he didn’t receive.</p>

<h3 id="_recap">6.7. Recap</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter has described the blockchain and how it enables full nodes
to prove if Lisa has tried to delete or change transactions. The
blockchain is a sequence of blocks that are connected through
cryptographic hashes.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch06/u06-08.svg" alt="u06 08" width="100%">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The merkle root in the block header is the combined hash of all
contained transactions. This hash is created by hashing the transactions
in a merkle tree structure. Hashes are concatenated pairwise, and the
result is hashed to get one level closer to the root.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch06/u06-10.svg" alt="u06 10" width="50%">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A full node can prove to a lightweight wallet that a transaction is in a
block by sending a merkle proof to the wallet. The merkle proof consists
of the block header and a partial merkle tree. The merkle proof grows
logarithmically with the number of transactions in the block.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch06/u06-11.svg" alt="u06 11" width="75%">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For privacy reasons, wallets don’t want just the transactions they’re
actually interested in. To obfuscate what addresses belong to it, the
wallet uses bloom filters to subscribe to more transactions than those
that are actually interesting. It creates a bloom filter and sends it to
the full node.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ch06/u06-12.svg" alt="u06 12" width="50%">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The full node tests various stuff from the transactions—for example,
PKHs in outputs—using the three hash functions. If any such item hashes
to indexes all containing <code>1</code>, then the node will send the transaction.
If not, it won’t send the transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter has solved the issue with deleted or changed transactions.
Lisa can’t change the contents of the blockchain without being proven a
fraud.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lisa can still censor transactions. She can refuse to confirm
transactions being sent to her. She has ultimate power over what goes
into the blockchain and what doesn’t. In <a href="#ch07">[ch07]</a>, we’ll make it much
harder for a single actor like Lisa to make such decisions.</p>
